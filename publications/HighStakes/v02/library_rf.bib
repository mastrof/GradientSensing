  abstract = {Bacteria have evolved the ability to monitor changes in various physico-chemical parameters and to adapt their physiology and metabolism by implementing appropriate cellular responses to these changes. Energy taxis is a metabolism-dependent form of taxis and is the directed movement of motile bacteria in gradients of physico-chemical parameters that affect metabolism. Energy taxis has been described in diverse bacterial species and several dedicated energy sensors have been identified. The molecular mechanism of energy taxis has not been studied in as much detail as chemotaxis, but experimental evidence indicates that this behaviour differs from metabolism-independent taxis only by the presence of dedicated energy taxis receptors. Energy taxis receptors perceive changes in energy-related parameters, including signals related to the redox and/or intracellular energy status of the cell. The best-characterized energy taxis receptors are those that sense the redox state of the electron transport chain via non-covalently bound FAD cofactors. Other receptors shown to mediate energy taxis lack any recognizable redox cofactor or conserved energy-sensing motif, and some have been suggested to monitor changes in the proton motive force. The exact energy-sensing mechanism(s) involved are yet to be elucidated for most of these energy sensors. By monitoring changes in energy-related parameters, energy taxis receptors allow cells to couple motility behaviour with metabolism under diverse environmental conditions. Energy taxis receptors thus provide fruitful models to decipher how cells integrate sensory behaviours with metabolic activities.},

These experiments are challenging because the proposed LLPT occurs under extreme metastable conditions where the liquid freezes to a crystal on a very short time scale. Here, we analyze models for the LLPT to show that coexistence of distinct high-density and low-density liquid phases may be observed by subjecting low-density amorphous (LDA) ice to ultrafast heating. We then describe experiments in which we heat LDA ice to near the predicted critical point of the LLPT by an ultrafast infrared laser pulse, following which we measure the structure factor using femtosecond x-ray laser pulses. Consistent with our predictions, we observe a LLPT occurring on a time scale\,{$<$}\,100 ns and widely separated from ice formation, which begins at times {$>$}1 {$\mu$}s.},

Further, we review and develop simple theoretical arguments for observed scaling laws and the characteristic sizes of a change or breakdown of power laws. We divide life in the ocean into seven major realms based on trophic strategy, physiology, and life history strategy. Such a categorization represents a move away from a taxonomically oriented description toward a trait-based description of life in the oceans.

How the chemotaxis network in               Helicobacter pylori               modulates flagellar functions is unknown, which limits our understanding of chemotaxis in this species. Here, we determined that               H. pylori               swim faster (slower) whenever their flagella rotate counterclockwise (clockwise) by analyzing their hydrodynamic interactions with bounding surfaces. This asymmetry in swimming helped quantify the rotational bias. Upon exposure to a chemo-attractant, the bias decreased and the cells tended to swim exclusively in the faster mode. In the absence of a key chemotaxis protein, CheY, the bias was zero. The relationship between the reversal frequency and the rotational bias was unimodal. Thus,               H. pylori               's chemotaxis network appears to modulate the probability of clockwise rotation in otherwise counterclockwise-rotating flagella, similar to the canonical network.},

How elongation affects encounter rates between phytoplankton in turbulence has remained unknown, yet encounters control the formation of marine snow in the ocean. Here, we present simulations of encounters among elongated phytoplankton in turbulence, showing that encounter rates between neutrally buoyant elongated cells are up to 10-fold higher than for spherical cells and even higher when cells sink. Consequently, we predict that elongation can significantly speed up the formation of marine snow compared to spherical cells. This unexpectedly large effect of morphology in driving encounter rates among plankton provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the rapid clearance of many phytoplankton blooms.},

  abstract = {Unicellular algae, termed phytoplankton, greatly impact the marine environment by serving as the basis of marine food webs and by playing central roles in the biogeochemical cycling of elements. The interactions between phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria affect the fitness of both partners. It is becoming increasingly recognized that metabolic exchange determines the nature of such interactions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain underexplored. Here, we investigated the molecular and metabolic basis for the bacterial lifestyle switch, from coexistence to pathogenicity, in               Sulfitobacter               D7 during its interaction with               Emiliania huxleyi               , a cosmopolitan bloom-forming phytoplankter. To unravel the bacterial lifestyle switch, we analyzed bacterial transcriptomes in response to exudates derived from algae in exponential growth and stationary phase, which supported the               Sulfitobacter               D7 coexistence and pathogenicity lifestyles, respectively. In pathogenic mode,               Sulfitobacter               D7 upregulated flagellar motility and diverse transport systems, presumably to maximize assimilation of               E. huxleyi               -derived metabolites released by algal cells upon cell death. Algal dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) was a pivotal signaling molecule that mediated the transition between the lifestyles, supporting our previous findings. However, the coexisting and pathogenic lifestyles were evident only in the presence of additional algal metabolites. Specifically, we discovered that algae-produced benzoate promoted the growth of               Sulfitobacter               D7 and hindered the DMSP-induced lifestyle switch to pathogenicity, demonstrating that benzoate is important for maintaining the coexistence of algae and bacteria. We propose that bacteria can sense the physiological state of the algal host through changes in the metabolic composition, which will determine the bacterial lifestyle during interaction.},

To facilitate the phenotyping of microalgae and cyanobacteria, we developed ``PhenoChip,'' a platform for the multiparametric photophysiological characterization and selection of unicellular phenotypes under user-controlled physicochemical conditions. We used PhenoChip to expose single cells of the coral symbiont               Symbiodinium               to thermal and chemical treatments and monitor single-cell photophysiology via chlorophyll fluorometry. This revealed strain-specific thermal sensitivity thresholds and distinct pH optima for photosynthetic performance, and permitted the identification of single cells with elevated resilience toward rising temperature. Optical expulsion technology was used to collect single cells from PhenoChip, and their propagation revealed indications of transgenerational preservation of photosynthetic phenotypes. PhenoChip represents a versatile platform for the phenotyping of photosynthetic unicells relevant to biotechnology, ecotoxicology, and assisted evolution.},

Also, these learners might argue that the battery always delivers the same amount of electric current or that current is used up in, e.g., a light bulb.},

  abstract = {Inside prokaryotic cells, passive translational diffusion typically limits the rates with which cytoplasmic proteins can reach their locations. Diffusion is thus fundamental to most cellular processes, but the understanding of protein mobility in the highly crowded and non-homogeneous environment of a bacterial cell is still limited. Here, we investigated the mobility of a large set of proteins in the cytoplasm of               Escherichia coli               , by employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) combined with simulations and theoretical modeling. We conclude that cytoplasmic protein mobility could be well described by Brownian diffusion in the confined geometry of the bacterial cell and at the high viscosity imposed by macromolecular crowding. We observed similar size dependence of protein diffusion for the majority of tested proteins, whether native or foreign to               E. coli               . For the faster-diffusing proteins, this size dependence is well consistent with the Stokes-Einstein relation once taking into account the specific dumbbell shape of protein fusions. Pronounced subdiffusion and hindered mobility are only observed for proteins with extensive interactions within the cytoplasm. Finally, while protein diffusion becomes markedly faster in actively growing cells, at high temperature, or upon treatment with rifampicin, and slower at high osmolarity, all of these perturbations affect proteins of different sizes in the same proportions, which could thus be described as changes of a well-defined cytoplasmic viscosity.},

  abstract = {Variability in the environment defines the structure and dynamics of all living systems, from organisms to ecosystems. Species have evolved traits and strategies that allow them to detect, exploit and predict the changing environment. These traits allow organisms to maintain steady internal conditions required for physiological functioning through feedback mechanisms that allow internal conditions to remain at or near a set-point despite a fluctuating environment. In addition to feedback, many organisms have evolved feedforward processes, which allow them to adjust in anticipation of an expected future state of the environment. Here we provide a framework describing how feedback and feedforward mechanisms operating within organisms can generate effects across scales of organization, and how they allow living systems to persist in fluctuating environments. Daily, seasonal and multi-year cycles provide cues that organisms use to anticipate changes in physiologically relevant environmental conditions. Using feedforward mechanisms, organisms can exploit correlations in environmental variables to prepare for anticipated future changes. Strategies to obtain, store and act on information about the conditional nature of future events are advantageous and are evidenced in widespread phenotypes such as circadian clocks, social behaviour, diapause and migrations. Humans are altering the ways in which the environment fluctuates, causing correlations between environmental variables to become decoupled, decreasing the reliability of cues. Human-induced environmental change is also altering sensory environments and the ability of organisms to detect cues. Recognizing that living systems combine feedback and feedforward processes is essential to understanding their responses to current and future regimes of environmental fluctuations.

However, how pore-scale confinement alters bacterial motility is unknown due to the opacity of typical 3D media. As a result, models of migration are limited and often employ ad hoc assumptions. Here we reveal that the paradigm of run-and-tumble motility is dramatically altered in a porous medium. By directly visualizing individual               Escherichia coli               , we find that the cells are intermittently and transiently trapped as they navigate the pore space, exhibiting diffusive behavior at long time scales. The trapping durations and the lengths of ``hops'' between traps are broadly distributed, reminiscent of transport in diverse other disordered systems; nevertheless, we show that these quantities can together predict the long-time bacterial translational diffusivity. Our work thus provides a revised picture of bacterial motility in complex media and yields principles for predicting cellular migration.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic model of a simplified microbial food web was implemented based on spatially explicit transport of nutrients and energy sources by molecular diffusion. Individual organisms were simulated to interact in a two-dimensional arena consisting of 70 {\texttimes} 70 interconnected hexagonal compartments each of 2 nl in volume. Release of dissolved organic matter in conjunction with predation events resulted in patches of increased concentration lasting long enough to be consumed completely by bacteria before being dispersed. Individual bacteria encountered concentrations of dissolved organic matter varying up to 100-fold within time scales significant for growth. The simulations also predicted that given a chemotactic response to nutrient gradients, bacteria could grow 50\% faster on average when gathered in loose clusters within patches. Extending the scenario to the three-dimensional case and looking at a 1-ml volume, patch-generating events were estimated to occur several times per hour and spread to within a few millimeters in radius before being eroded by bacteria. The erosion time scale is probably longer than the time between patch appearances resulting in patches overlapping and creating a markedly inhomogeneous microenvironment. In such a scenario, foraging strategies enabling bacteria and predators to respond to elevated concentrations of food could represent a significant adaptive advantage.},

Here, we demonstrate experimentally using millifluidic devices that although bacterial motility is essential for effective colonization of a particle leaking organic nutrients into the water column, chemotaxis specifically benefits at intermediate and higher settling velocities to navigate the particle boundary layer during the brief window of opportunity provided by a passing particle. We develop an individual-based model that simulates the encounter and attachment of bacterial cells with leaking marine particles to systematically evaluate the role of different parameters associated with bacterial run-and-tumble motility. We further use this model to explore the role of particle microstructure on the colonization efficiency of bacteria with different motility traits. We find that the porous microstructure facilitates additional colonization by chemotactic and motile bacteria, and fundamentally alters the way non-motile cells interact with particles due to streamlines intersecting with the particle surface.},

Positive gradients suppress directional changes which occur spontaneously in the absence of a stimulus. Negative gradients have little effect. The data can be fit with a model in which the suppression is proportional to the time rate of change of the fractional amount of chemoreceptor bound. The model accounts for the behavior of individual cells and populations of cells in spatial gradients. A computer simulation of the motion in spatial gradients indicates that if the bacteria have a ``memory,'' its decay time cannot be much longer than a few seconds. The relationship between the responses observed in these experiments and in experiments in which solutions of an attractant at different concentrations are mixed is discussed.},

In many cases, these regions of high bacterial concentration are thought to form when motile cells use chemotaxis to navigate to chemical hotspots. However, what governs the dynamics of bacterial aggregations is unclear. Here, we use an experimental platform to create realistic submillimeter-scale nutrient pulses with controlled nutrient concentrations. By combining experiments, mathematical theory, and agent-based simulations, we show that individual               Vibrio ordalii               bacteria begin chemotaxis toward hotspots of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when the magnitude of the chemical gradient rises sufficiently far above the sensory noise that is generated by stochastic encounters with chemoattractant molecules. Each DOM hotspot is surrounded by a dynamic ring of chemotaxing cells, which congregate in regions of high DOM concentration before dispersing as DOM diffuses and gradients become too noisy for cells to respond to. We demonstrate that               V. ordalii               operates close to the theoretical limits on chemotactic precision. Numerical simulations of chemotactic bacteria, in which molecule counting noise is explicitly taken into account, point at a tradeoff between nutrient acquisition and the cost of chemotactic precision.

  abstract = {The ability of marine microbes to navigate toward chemical hotspots can determine their nutrient uptake and has the potential to affect the cycling of elements in the ocean. The link between bacterial navigation and nutrient cycling highlights the need to understand how chemotaxis functions in the context of marine microenvironments. Chemotaxis hinges on the stochastic binding/unbinding of molecules with surface receptors, the transduction of this information through an intracellular signaling cascade, and the activation and control of flagellar motors. The intrinsic randomness of these processes is a central challenge that cells must deal with in order to navigate, particularly under dilute conditions where noise and signal are similar in magnitude. Such conditions are ubiquitous in the ocean, where nutrient concentrations are often extremely low and subject to rapid variation in space (e.g., particulate matter, nutrient plumes) and time (e.g., diffusing sources, fluid mixing). Stochastic, biophysical models of chemotaxis have the potential to illuminate how bacteria cope with noise to efficiently navigate in such environments. At the same time, new technologies for experimentation allow for continuous interrogation{\textemdash}from milliseconds through to days{\textemdash}of bacterial responses in custom dynamic nutrient landscapes, providing unprecedented access to the behavior of chemotactic cells in microenvironments engineered to mimic those cells navigate in the wild. These recent theoretical and experimental developments have created an opportunity to derive population-level uptake from single-cell motility characteristics in ways that could inform the next generation of marine biogeochemical cycling models.},

We comment on the mean flow organization and on the turbulence properties of such jets by comparing the results with those obtained with square grids, a regular grid (having the same effective mesh length) and a jet without turbulator. We find that, different from the case of decaying grid turbulence, a correction must be accounted for to properly scale the turbulence intensity profiles with a length scale based on grid parameters. We perform a low-order reconstruction of the velocity field based on the most energetic proper orthogonal decomposition modes and we compare the flow-field structure produced in the lee of fractal grids with a single square object and the jet without turbulator. The typical turbulence intensity profile detailed in Cafiero               et al.               (               Phys. Fluids               , vol. 27, 2015, 115103) for jets with fractal grids is produced by the interaction of small eddies shed by the central grid item. In the single square grid case, the turbulence is built upon the interaction between larger structures. Conversely, the interaction of the outward spreading wake with the external shear layer produces pairs of vortical structures, which we relate to the higher entrainment rate featured by jets with fractal turbulators. The secondary grid iterations have a disruptive effect on the turbulence transport, with a corresponding large correlation between the velocity fluctuations at the jet core with those at the jet shear layer.},

To represent the proposed high-density liquid structures, we use a model consisting of chains of water molecules, and for low-density liquid, we investigate fused dodecahedra as templates for tetrahedral fluctuations. The computed infrared spectra of the models are in very good agreement with the extracted experimental spectra for the two components, while the extracted structures from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations give spectra that are intermediate between the experimentally derived spectra. Computed x-ray absorption and emission spectra as well as the O{\textendash}O radial distribution functions of the proposed structures are not contradicted by experiment. The stability of the proposed dodecahedral template structures is investigated in MD simulations by seeding the starting structure, and remnants found to persist on an {$\sim$}30 ps time scale. We discuss the possible significance of such seeds in simulations and whether they can be viable candidates as templates for structural fluctuations below the compressibility minimum of liquid water.},

  abstract = {Regular environmental conditions allow for the evolution of specifically adapted responses, whereas complex environments usually lead to conflicting requirements upon the organism's response. A relevant instance of these issues is bacterial chemotaxis, where the evolutionary and functional reasons for the experimentally observed response to chemoattractants remain a riddle. Sensing and motility requirements are in fact optimized by different responses, which strongly depend on the chemoattractant environmental profiles. It is not clear then how those conflicting requirements quantitatively combine and compromise in shaping the chemotaxis response. Here we show that the experimental bacterial response corresponds to the maximin strategy that ensures the highest minimum uptake of chemoattractants for               any               profile of concentration. We show that the maximin response is the unique one that always outcompetes motile but nonchemotactic bacteria. The maximin strategy is adapted to the variable environments experienced by bacteria, and we explicitly show its emergence in simulations of bacterial populations in a chemostat. Finally, we recast the contrast of evolution in regular vs. complex environments in terms of minimax vs. maximin game-theoretical strategies. Our results are generally relevant to biological optimization principles and provide a systematic possibility to get around the need to know precisely the statistics of environmental fluctuations.},

Subsequently, it has been argued that the predictions of the SLC are inconsistent with general thermodynamic principles. Here, we reconsider the thermodynamic viability of the SLC by examining a model equation of state for water which was first studied to clarify the relationship of the SLC to the proposed liquid-liquid phase transition in supercooled water. By demonstrating that a binodal may terminate on a spinodal at a point that is not a critical point, we show that the SLC is thermodynamically permissible in a system that has both a liquid-gas and a liquid-liquid phase transition.

Motile cilia allow the swimming of cells and small organisms and transport of liquids across epithelial tissues. Whilst the molecular structure is now very well understood, the dynamics of cilia is not well established either at the single cilium level nor at the level of collective beating. Indeed, a full understanding of this requires connecting together behaviour across various lengthscales, from the molecular to the organelle, then at the cellular level and up to the tissue scale. Aside from the fundamental interest in this system, understanding beating is important to elucidate aspects of embryonic development and a variety of health conditions from fertility to genetic and infectious diseases of the airways.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The ability of marine bacteria to direct their movement in response to chemical gradients influences inter-species interactions, nutrient turnover, and ecosystem productivity. While many bacteria are chemotactic towards small metabolites, marine organic matter is predominantly composed of large molecules and polymers. Yet, the signalling role of these large molecules is largely unknown. Using in situ and laboratory-based chemotaxis assays, we show that marine bacteria are strongly attracted to the abundant algal polysaccharides laminarin and alginate. Unexpectedly, these polysaccharides elicited stronger chemoattraction than their oligo- and monosaccharide constituents. Furthermore, chemotaxis towards laminarin was strongly enhanced by dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), another ubiquitous algal-derived metabolite. Our results indicate that DMSP acts as a methyl donor for marine bacteria, increasing their gradient detection capacity and facilitating their access to polysaccharide patches. We demonstrate that marine bacteria are capable of strong chemotaxis towards large soluble polysaccharides and uncover a new ecological role for DMSP in enhancing this attraction. These navigation behaviours may contribute to the rapid turnover of polymers in the ocean, with important consequences for marine carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

Superficially, antibiotic production fits this picture as individuals can gain most benefit by inhibiting or killing close relatives with high niche overlap. Contrary to that notion,                                Cordero                 et al.                              (p.               1228               ; see the Perspective by                                Morlon                              ) show that bacteria in the wild form social units in which antibiotic production and resistance leads to cooperation within, and antagonism between, populations. A combination of high-throughput interaction screening, molecular genetics, and genomics revealed that antibiotics are produced by only a few members of each population, while all other members are resistant. In the past, lack of knowledge of the ecological structure of microbial populations has led to interpretations of antibiotic production and resistance as being largely driven by short-lived, cyclic invasions of populations by antibiotic-producing resistant bacteria. This work shows that structured, socially cohesive bacterial populations exist in the wild and form organizational patterns similar to those of animal and plant populations.                        ,              Natural antibiotics enforce competition between, rather than within, bacterial populations.           ,              In animals and plants, social structure can reduce conflict within populations and bias aggression toward competing populations; however, for bacteria in the wild it remains unknown whether such population-level organization exists. Here, we show that environmental bacteria are organized into socially cohesive units in which antagonism occurs between rather than within ecologically defined populations. By screening approximately 35,000 possible mutual interactions among Vibrionaceae isolates from the ocean, we show that genotypic clusters known to have cohesive habitat association also act as units in terms of antibiotic production and resistance. Genetic analyses show that within populations, broad-range antibiotics are produced by few genotypes, whereas all others are resistant, suggesting cooperation between conspecifics. Natural antibiotics may thus mediate competition between populations rather than solely increase the success of individuals.},

The application we make here provides a thermodynamic description of supercooled water fully consistent with that expected by crossing the liquid{\textendash}liquid Widom line, indicating the presence of two distinct liquid states. In particular, the present model accurately reproduces the Widom line temperatures estimated with other two-state models and well describes the heat capacity anomalies. Differently from previous models, according to our description, a cluster of molecules that extends beyond the first hydration shell is necessary to discriminate between the statistical fluctuation regimes typical of the two liquid states.},

The formation of this extracellular environment, and the associated bacterial biodiversity, is heavily influenced by the secretion of extracellular polymers, primarily driven by phototrophic organisms. The exopolysaccharides (EPS) represent the largest fraction of the microalgae-derived exudates, which can be specifically used by heterotrophic bacteria as substrates for metabolic processes. Furthermore, it has been proposed that bacteria and their extracellular factors play a role in both the release and composition of the EPS. In this study, two model microorganisms, the diatom               Phaeodactylum tricornutum               CCAP 1055/15 and the bacterium               Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis               TAC125, were co-cultured in a dual system to assess how their interactions modify the phycosphere chemical composition by analyzing the EPS monosaccharide profile released in the culture media by the two partners. We demonstrate that microalgal{\textendash}bacterial interactions in this simplified model significantly influenced the architecture of their extracellular environment. We observed that the composition of the exo-environment, as described by the EPS monosaccharide profiles, varied under different culture conditions and times of incubation.

  abstract = {The anomalous properties of cold and supercooled water, such as the fact that at sufficiently low temperatures it becomes more compressible and less dense when cooled, and more fluid when compressed, have attracted the attention of physical scientists for a long time. The discovery in the 1970s that several thermodynamic and transport properties of supercooled water exhibit a pronounced temperature dependence and appear to diverge slightly below the homogeneous nucleation temperature inspired a large number of experimental and theoretical studies. Likewise, an important body of work on glassy water has been stimulated by experiments, starting in the mid-1980s and continuing to this date, which suggest that vitreous water can exist in at least two apparently distinct forms. A coherent theory of the thermodynamic and transport properties of supercooled and glassy water does not yet exist. Nevertheless, significant progress towards this goal has been made during the past 20 years. This article summarizes the known experimental facts and reviews critically theoretical and computational work aimed at interpreting the observations and providing a unified viewpoint on cold, non-crystalline, metastable states of water.},

Matter 15 R1669) I used a thermodynamic consistency argument to rule out the possibility, proposed originally by Speedy (1982 J. Phys. Chem. 86 982), that the spinodal curve for superheated liquid water can retrace to positive pressure. The argument is based on the impossibility that a thermodynamic state other than a critical point be a limit of stability (i.e., a point along a spinodal line) and simultaneously coexist with another phase. Speedy's comment offers a counter-example involving the freezing transition to argue that a thermodynamic state can in fact be a limit of stability (spinodal) and simultaneously coexist with a different phase (i.e., a non-critical point along the phase coexistence locus). Here I argue that instability to infinitesimal density fluctuations and coexistence with a different phase are mutually exclusive conditions.},

  abstract = {Predatory protozoa play an essential role in shaping microbial populations. Among these protozoa,               Acanthamoeba               are ubiquitous in the soil and aqueous environments inhabited by               Listeria monocytogenes               . Observations of predator{\textendash}prey interactions between these two microorganisms revealed a predation strategy in which               Acanthamoeba castellanii               assemble               L. monocytogenes               in aggregates, termed backpacks, on their posterior. The rapid formation and specific location of backpacks led to the assumption that               A. castellanii               may recruit               L. monocytogenes               by releasing an attractant. However, this hypothesis has not been validated, and the mechanisms driving this process remained unknown. Here, we combined video microscopy, microfluidics, single-cell image analyses, and theoretical modeling to characterize predator{\textendash}prey interactions of               A. castellanii               and               L. monocytogenes               and determined whether bacterial chemotaxis contributes to the backpack formation. Our results indicate that               L. monocytogenes               captures are not driven by chemotaxis. Instead, random encounters of bacteria with amoebae initialize bacterial capture and aggregation. This is supported by the strong correlation between experimentally derived capture rates and theoretical encounter models at the single-cell level. Observations of the spatial rearrangement of               L. monocytogenes               trapped by               A. castellanii               revealed that bacterial aggregation into backpacks is mainly driven by amoeboid locomotion. Overall, we show that two nonspecific, independent mechanisms, namely random encounters enhanced by bacterial motility and predator surface-bound locomotion, drive backpack formation, resulting in a bacterial aggregate on the amoeba ready for phagocytosis. Due to the prevalence of these two processes in the environment, we expect this strategy to be widespread among amoebae, contributing to their effectiveness as predators.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Swimming organisms may actively adjust their behavior in response to the flow around them. Ocean flows are typically turbulent and are therefore characterized by chaotic velocity fluctuations. While some studies have observed planktonic larvae altering their behavior in response to turbulence, it is not always clear whether a plankter is responding to an individual turbulence fluctuation or to the time-averaged flow. To distinguish between these two paradigms, we conducted laboratory experiments with larvae in turbulence. We observed veliger larvae of the gastropod Crepidula fornicata in a jet-stirred turbulence tank while simultaneously measuring two components of the fluid and larval velocity. Larvae were studied at two different stages of development, early and late, and their behavior was analyzed in response to different characteristics of turbulence: acceleration, dissipation and vorticity. Our analysis considered the effects of both the time-averaged flow and the instantaneous flow, around the larvae. Overall, we found that both stages of larvae increased their upward swimming speeds in response to increasing turbulence. However, we found that the early-stage larvae tended to respond to the time-averaged flow, whereas the late-stage larvae tended to respond to the instantaneous flow around them. These observations indicate that larvae can integrate flow information over time and that their behavioral responses to turbulence can depend on both their present and past flow environments.},

The self-contained incubator-enclosed brightfield microscope monitors monocyte to macrophage cell differentiation for seven days at cellular resolution level (e.g. 2\,{$\mu$}m). Furthermore, by including very few additional components, the geometry is transferred into a 400~Euro~light~sheet fluorescence microscope for volumetric observations of a transgenic Zebrafish expressing~green fluorescent protein (GFP). With this, we aim to establish an open standard in optics to facilitate interfacing with various complementary platforms.

  abstract = {Microbial foraging in patchy environments, where resources are fragmented into particles or pockets embedded in a large matrix, plays a key role in natural environments. In the oceans and freshwater systems, particle-associated bacteria can interact with particle surfaces in different ways: some colonize only during short transients, while others form long-lived, stable colonies. We do not yet understand the ecological mechanisms by which both short- and long-term colonizers can coexist. Here, we address this problem with a mathematical model that explains how marine populations with different detachment rates from particles can stably coexist. In our model, populations grow only while on particles, but also face the increased risk of mortality by predation and sinking. Key to coexistence is the idea that detachment from particles modulates both net growth and mortality, but in opposite directions, creating a trade-off between them. While slow-detaching populations show the highest growth return (i.e., produce more net offspring), they are more susceptible to suffer higher rates of mortality than fast-detaching populations. Surprisingly, fluctuating environments, manifesting as blooms of particles (favoring growth) and predators (favoring mortality) significantly expand the likelihood that populations with different detachment rates can coexist. Our study shows how the spatial ecology of microbes in the ocean can lead to a predictable diversification of foraging strategies and the coexistence of multiple taxa on a single growth-limiting resource.},

  abstract = {One of the most accepted hypothesis to explain the anomalous behavior of water is the presence of a critical point between two liquids, the liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point (LLCP), buried within the deep supercooled regime. Unfortunately, such hypothesis is hard to be experimentally confirmed due to fast freezing. Here, we show that the TIP4P/Ice water potential shifted by 400 bar can reproduce with unprecedented accuracy the experimental isothermal compressibility of water and its liquid equation of state for a wide pressure and temperature range. We find, both by extrapolation of response function maxima and by a Maxwell construction, that the location of the model LLCP is consistent with previous calculations. According to the pressure shift needed to recover the experimental behavior of supercooled water, we estimate the experimental LLCP to be located around 1250 bar and 195~K. We use the model to estimate the ice nucleation rate (J) in the vicinity of the hypothesized LLCP experimental location and obtain J = 1024 m-3 s-1. Thereby, experiments where the ratio between the cooling rate and the sample volume is equal or larger than the estimated nucleation rate could probe liquid{\textendash}liquid equilibrium before freezing. Such conditions are not accessible in common experiments with microdroplets cooled at a few kelvin per second, but they could be, for instance, using nanodroplets of around 50~nm radius observed in a millisecond timescale.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Immiscible hydrocarbons occur in the ocean water column as droplets of varying diameters. Although microbial oil degradation is a central process in the remediation of hydrocarbon pollution in marine environments, the relationship between droplet size distribution and oil degradation rates by bacteria remains unclear, with a conflicting history of laboratory studies. Despite this knowledge gap, the use of chemical dispersants in oil spill response and mitigation is based on the rationale that increasing the surface-area-to-volume ratio of droplets will enhance net bacterial biodegradation rates. We demonstrate that this intuitive argument does not apply to most natural marine environments, where the abundance of oil droplets is much lower than in laboratory experiments and droplet-bacteria encounters are the limiting factor. We present a mechanistic encounter-consumption model to predict the characteristic time for oil degradation by marine bacteria as a function of the initial oil concentration, the distribution of droplet sizes, and the initial abundance of oil-degrading bacteria. We find that the tradeoff between the encounter time and the consumption time leads to an optimal droplet size larger than the average size generated by the application of dispersants. Reducing droplet size below this optimum can increase the persistence of oil droplets in the environment from weeks to years. The new perspective granted by this biophysical model of biodegradation that explicitly accounts for oil{\textendash}microbe encounters changes our understanding of biodegradation particularly in the deep ocean, where droplets are often small and oil concentrations low, and explains degradation rate discrepancies between laboratory and field studies.},

In this Very Short Introduction John Finney introduces the science of water, and explores how the structure of water molecules gives rise to its physical and chemical properties. Considering water in all three of its states as ice and steam as well as liquid, Finney explains the great importance of an understanding of its structure and behaviour to a range of fields including chemistry, astrophysics, and earth and environmental sciences. Finney describes the role of water in biology, and ends with a discussion of of the outstanding controversies concerning water, and some of the 'magical' properties which have been claimed for it},

Most research on ice nucleation (and crystallization in general) has focused on understanding the former with less attention paid to the latter. However, supercooled water exhibits fascinating and complex dynamical behavior, most notably dynamical heterogeneity (DH), a phenomenon where spatially separated domains of relatively mobile and immobile particles coexist. Strikingly, the microscopic connection between the DH of water and the nucleation of ice has yet to be unraveled directly at the molecular level. Here we tackle this issue via computer simulations which reveal that (               i               ) ice nucleation occurs in low-mobility regions of the liquid, (               ii               ) there is a dynamical incubation period in which the mobility of the molecules drops before any ice-like ordering, and (               iii               ) ice-like clusters cause arrested dynamics in surrounding water molecules. With this we establish a clear connection between dynamics and nucleation. We anticipate that our findings will pave the way for the examination of the role of dynamical heterogeneities in heterogeneous and solution-based nucleation.},

Until recently, social behavior in marine phytoplankton was assumed to rely mainly on the secretion of a variety of infochemicals that allowed population-scale collective responses. Here, we demonstrate that pelagic diatoms also use Sun-stimulated fluorescence signals for synchronizing their behavior. These unicellular microorganisms, playing a key biogeochemical role in the ocean, use photoreceptor proteins and red{\textendash}far-red fluorescent radiation to communicate. A characteristic beaconing signal is generated by rhythmic organelle displacement within the cell cytoplasm, triggering coordinated population behavior. These light-based communication networks could critically determine major facets of diatom ecology and fitness and regulate the dynamics of larger-scale ocean processes.},

However, different topologies arise depending on how rings are counted, leading to incomplete or even contrasting physical interpretations. Solving this critical ambiguity is of primary importance for the correct assessment of material properties. Here, we show how such differences emerge in water, a complex network-forming material endowed with polyamorphism and a directional network of hydrogen bonds whose topology is correlated with the anomalous behavior of water. We probe the network in the liquid state at several thermodynamic points under equilibrium conditions, as well as during the out-of-equilibrium first-order-like low density to high density amorphous transformation. We study three schemes for counting rings and show that each of them provides complementary insightful information about the network, suggesting that a single counting scheme may not be sufficient to properly describe network topologies and to assess material properties. Our results provide a molecular description of the rings in supercooled water and of the amorphous-to-amorphous transformation kinetics, hence shedding light on the complex nature of water. Nonetheless, our results expose how delicate the proper choice of method for counting rings is, an issue with important consequences for rationalizing the properties of network-forming materials at large.},

  abstract = {Bacterial chemotaxis systems are as diverse as the environments that bacteria inhabit, but how much environmental variation can cells tolerate with a single system? Diversification of a single chemotaxis system could serve as an alternative, or even evolutionary stepping-stone, to switching between multiple systems. We hypothesized that mutations in gene regulation could lead to heritable control of chemotactic diversity. By simulating foraging and colonization of E. coli using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables adaptation to environmental variability.           ,              Bacterial colonies are generally made up of genetically identical cells. Despite this, a closer look at the members of a bacterial colony shows that these cells can have very different behaviors. For example, some cells may grow more quickly than others, or be more resistant to antibiotics. The mechanisms driving this diversity are only beginning to be identified and understood.             Escherichia coli bacteria can move towards, or away from, certain chemicals in their surrounding environment to help them navigate toward favorable conditions. This behavior is known as chemotaxis. The signals from all of these chemicals are processed in E. coli by just one set of proteins, which control the different behaviors that are needed for the bacteria to follow them. Different numbers of these proteins are found in different{\textemdash}but genetically identical{\textemdash}bacteria, and the number of proteins is linked to how the bacteria perform these behaviors.             It has been suggested that diversity can be beneficial to the overall bacterial population, as it helps the population survive environmental changes. This suggests that the level of diversity in the population should adapt to the level of diversity in the environment. However, it remains unknown how this adaptation occurs.             Frankel et al. developed and combined several models and simulations to investigate whether differences in chemotaxis protein production help an E. coli colony to survive. The models show that in different environments, it can be beneficial for the population as a whole if different cells have different responses to the chemicals present. For example, if a lot of a useful chemical is present, bacteria are more likely to survive by heading straight to the source. If not much chemical is detected, the bacteria may need to move in a more exploratory manner.             Frankel et al. find that different amounts of chemotaxis proteins produce these different behaviors. To survive in a changing environment, it is therefore best for the E. coli colony to contain cells that have different amounts of these proteins. Frankel et al. propose that the variability of chemotaxis protein levels between genetically identical cells can change through mutations in the genes that control how many of the proteins are produced, and predict that such mutations allow populations to adapt to environmental changes.             The environments simulated in the model were much simpler than would be found in the real world, and Frankel et al. describe experiments that are now being performed to confirm and expand on their results. The model could be used in the future to shed light on the behavior of other cells that are genetically identical but exhibit diverse behaviors, from other bacterial species to more complex cancer cells.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have revealed that closely related strains of the same microbial species can stably coexist in natural and laboratory settings subject to boom and bust dynamics and serial dilutions, respectively. However, the possible mechanisms enabling the coexistence of only a handful of strains, but not more, have thus far remained unknown. Here, using a consumer-resource model of microbial ecosystems, we propose that by differentiating along Monod parameters characterizing microbial growth rates in high and low nutrient conditions, strains can coexist in patterns similar to those observed. In our model, boom and bust environments create satellite niches due to resource concentrations varying in time. These satellite niches can be occupied by closely related strains, thereby enabling their coexistence. We demonstrate that this result is valid even in complex environments consisting of multiple resources and species. In these complex communities, each species partitions resources differently and creates separate sets of satellite niches for their own strains. While there is no theoretical limit to the number of coexisting strains, in our simulations, we always find between 1 and 3 strains coexisting, consistent with known experiments and observations.},

  abstract = {Water is the most abundant liquid on earth and also the substance with the largest number of anomalies in its properties. It is a prerequisite for life and as such a most important subject of current research in chemical physics and physical chemistry. In spite of its simplicity as a liquid, it has an enormously rich phase diagram where different types of ices, amorphous phases, and anomalies disclose a path that points to unique thermodynamics of its supercooled liquid state that still hides many unraveled secrets. In this review we describe the behavior of water in the regime from ambient conditions to the deeply supercooled region. The review describes simulations and experiments on this anomalous liquid. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomalous properties that become strongly enhanced in the supercooled region. Among those, the second critical-point scenario has been investigated extensively, and at present most experimental evidence point to this scenario. Starting from very low temperatures, a coexistence line between a high-density amorphous phase and a low-density amorphous phase would continue in a coexistence line between a high-density and a low-density liquid phase terminating in a liquid-liquid critical point, LLCP. On approaching this LLCP from the one-phase region, a crossover in thermodynamics and dynamics can be found. This is discussed based on a picture of a temperature-dependent balance between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid favored by, respectively, entropy and enthalpy, leading to a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of bulk water. Ice nucleation is also discussed, since this is what severely impedes experimental investigation of the vicinity of the proposed LLCP. Experimental investigation of stretched water, i.e., water at negative pressure, gives access to a different regime of the complex water diagram. Different ways to inhibit crystallization through confinement and aqueous solutions are discussed through results from experiments and simulations using the most sophisticated and advanced techniques. continued...},

Yet, knowledge of the amorphous phase is still insufficient, which may restrict its practical application. Here, we have studied the structural and bonding characteristics of amorphous Cu               2               Te by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We show that, compared with its crystal phase, the Cu atoms bond more Cu than Te atoms in amorphous Cu               2               Te and Te atoms predominantly bond with Cu atoms. In detail, the amorphous Cu               2               Te is made up of Cu{\textendash}Te network structures and Cu{\textendash}Cu high-coordinated configurations, presenting the hexagonal and icosahedral structures, respectively. This result is probably ascribed to both the stronger bonding ability of Cu{\textendash}Cu bonds and the multivalence of Te atoms. Our findings enrich the knowledge of the local structure and the bonding nature of amorphous Cu               2               Te, which can guide the design of good performance Cu               2               Te based thermoelectric devices further.},

  abstract = {The possible existence of a metastable liquid{\textendash}liquid transition (LLT) and a corresponding liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point (LLCP) in supercooled liquid water remains a topic of much debate. An LLT has been rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal{\textendash}multibaric ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an estimate of the LLCP's location. These combined results{\textemdash}obtained from a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters{\textemdash}are strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.},

However, the possible relationship between these phenomena remains incompletely understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the realistic TIP4P/2005 model, we found a striking signature of the liquid-liquid critical point in the structure of water glasses, manifested as a pronounced increase in long-range density fluctuations at pressures proximate to the critical pressure. By contrast, these signatures were absent in glasses of two model systems that lack a critical point. We also characterized the departure from equilibrium upon vitrification via the non-equilibrium index; water-like systems exhibited a strong pressure dependence in this metric, whereas simple liquids did not. These results reflect a surprising relationship between the metastable equilibrium phenomenon of liquid-liquid criticality and the non-equilibrium structure of glassy water, with implications for our understanding of water phase behavior and glass physics. Our calculations suggest a possible experimental route to probing the existence of the liquid-liquid transition in water and other fluids.},

Examples include molecular encounters in reactions, cellular signalling, the foraging of animals, the spread of diseases, as well as trends in financial markets and climate records. Deviations from Brownian diffusion, known as anomalous diffusion (AnDi), can often be observed in these processes, when the growth of the mean square displacement in time is not linear. An ever-increasing number of methods has thus appeared to characterize anomalous diffusion trajectories based on classical statistics or machine learning approaches. Yet, characterization of anomalous diffusion remains challenging to date as testified by the launch of the AnDi challenge in March 2020 to assess and compare new and pre-existing methods on three different aspects of the problem: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent, the classification of the diffusion model, and the segmentation of trajectories. Here, we introduce a novel method (CONDOR) which combines feature engineering based on classical statistics with supervised deep learning to efficiently identify the underlying anomalous diffusion model with high accuracy and infer its exponent with a small mean absolute error in single 1D, 2D and 3D trajectories corrupted by localization noise. Finally, we extend our method to the segmentation of trajectories where the diffusion model and/or its anomalous exponent vary in time.},

Theoretically, these points can be viewed as being generated by stochastic processes that in the simplest cases are Gaussian random walks on featureless landscapes. Generalizations have been made of walks that (               i               ) take place on landscapes with features, (               ii               ) have correlated distributions of velocity and direction of movement in each time interval, (               iii               ) are L{\'e}vy processes in which distance or waiting-time (time-between steps) distributions have infinite moments, or (               iv               ) have paths bounded in space and time. We begin by demonstrating that rather mild truncations of fat-tailed step-size distributions have a dramatic effect on dispersion of organisms, where such truncations naturally arise in real walks of organisms bounded by space and, more generally, influenced by the interactions of physiological, behavioral, and ecological factors with landscape features. These generalizations permit not only increased realism and hence greater accuracy in constructing movement pathways, but also provide a biogeographically detailed epistemological framework for interpreting movement patterns in all organisms, whether tossed in the wind or willfully driven. We illustrate the utility of our framework by demonstrating how fission{\textendash}fusion herding behavior arises among individuals endeavoring to satisfy both nutritional and safety demands in heterogeneous environments. We conclude with a brief discussion of potential methods that can be used to solve the inverse problem of identifying putative causal factors driving movement behavior on known landscapes, leaving details to references in the literature.},

  abstract = {The dysregulation of protein kinases is associated with multiple diseases due to the kinases' involvement in a variety of cell signaling pathways. Manipulating protein kinase function, by controlling the active site, is a promising therapeutic and investigative strategy to mitigate and study diseases. Kinase active sites share structural similarities making it difficult to specifically target one kinase, allosteric control allows specific regulation and study of kinase function without directly targeting the active site. Allosteric sites are distal to the active site but coupled via a dynamic network of inter-atomic interactions between residues in the protein. Establishing an allosteric control over a kinase requires understanding the allosteric wiring of the protein. Computational techniques offer effective and inexpensive mapping of the allosteric sites on a protein. Here, we discuss methods to map and regulate allosteric communications in proteins, and strategies to establish control over kinase functions in live cells and organisms. Protein molecules, or ``sensors'' are engineered to function as tools to control allosteric activity of the protein as these sensors have high spatiotemporal resolution and help in understanding cell phenotypes after immediate activation or inactivation of a kinase. Traditional methods used to study protein functions, such as knockout, knockdown, or mutation, cannot offer a sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolution. We discuss the modern repertoire of tools to regulate protein kinases as we enter a new era in deciphering cellular signaling and developing novel approaches to treat diseases associated with signal dysregulation.},

Cellular memory{\textemdash}the ability to track and condition the time to switch to a different phenotypic state{\textemdash}can help withstand environmental fluctuations. How does memory manifest itself in unicellular organisms? We describe the population-wide consequences of phenotypic memory in microbes through a combination of deterministic modelling and stochastic simulations. Moving beyond binary switching models, our work highlights the need to consider a broader range of switching behaviours when describing microbial adaptive strategies. We show that memory in individual cells generates patterns at the population level coherent with overshoots and non-exponential lag times distributions experimentally observed in phenotypically heterogeneous populations. We emphasise the implications of our work in understanding antibiotic tolerance and, in general, bacterial survival under fluctuating environments.},

Without a single exception, regardless of the nature or structure of S, all quantum descriptors of bonding yield stabilizing S{$\cdots$}water interactions, therefore, there is no evidence of repulsion and thus no reason for etymological hydrophobicity at the molecular level. Our results provide molecular insight behind the exclusion of S molecules by water, customarily invoked to explain phase separation and the formation of interfaces, in favor of a complex interplay between entropic, enthalpic, and dynamic factors. S{$\cdots$}water interfaces are not just thin films separating the two phases; instead, they are non-isotropic regions with density gradients for each component whose macroscopic stability is provided by a large number of very weak dihydrogen contacts. We offer a definition of interface as the region in which the density of the components in the A/B binary system is not constant. At a fundamental level, our results contribute to better current understanding of hydrophobicity.},

Maximal advantage is achieved when the memory is comparable to the time scale of fluctuations as perceived during swimming. We derive an analytical approximation for the drift velocity in rugged landscapes that explains the enhanced velocity, and recovers standard Keller{\textendash}Segel gradient-sensing results in the limits when memory and fluctuation time scales are well separated. Our numerics also show that cellular memory can induce bet-hedging at the population level resulting in long-lived, multi-modal distributions in heterogeneous landscapes.},

The well-studied navigation strategy of               Escherichia coli               forms a powerful paradigm that is widely assumed to translate to other bacterial species. This assumption is rarely tested because of a lack of techniques capable of bridging scales from individual navigation behavior to the resulting population-level chemotactic performance. Here, we present such a multiscale 3D chemotaxis assay by combining high-throughput 3D bacterial tracking with microfluidically created chemical gradients. Large datasets of 3D trajectories yield the statistical power required to assess chemotactic performance at the population level, while simultaneously resolving the underlying 3D navigation behavior for every individual. We demonstrate that surface effects confound typical 2D chemotaxis assays, and reveal that, contrary to previous reports,               Caulobacter crescentus               breaks with the               E. coli               paradigm.},

We explore a range of aspect ratios and sizes relevant to the dynamics of plankton and microplastics in water environments. The results presented here confirm that collision rates between elongated particles in a quiescent fluid are more frequent than those among spherical particles in turbulence due to oblique settling. We also demonstrate that turbulence generally enhances collisions among elongated particles as compared to those expected for a random distribution of the same particles settling in a quiescent fluid, although we also find a decrease in collision rates in turbulence for particles of the highest density and moderate aspect ratios (A=5). The increase in the collision rate due to turbulence is found to quickly decrease with aspect ratio, reach a minimum for aspect ratios approximately equal to 5, and then slowly increase again, with an increase up to 50\% for the largest aspect ratios investigated. This non-monotonic trend is explained as the result of two competing effects: the increase in the surface area with aspect ratio (beneficial to increase encounter rates) and the alignment of nearby prolate particles in turbulence (reducing the probability of collision). Turbulence mixing is, therefore, partially balanced by rod alignment at high particle aspect ratios.},

In contrast, most theoretical models of ecological interactions, especially large-scale models applied to societal issues such as climate change, resource management and human health, are based on `mean field' approaches in which the underlying patchiness of interacting consumers and resources is intentionally averaged out. Mean field ecological models typically have the advantages of tractability, few parameters and clear interpretation; more technically complex spatially explicit models, which resolve ecological patchiness at some (or all relevant) scales, generally lack these advantages.

The analysis uses scaling arguments to establish conditions under which key mechanisms{\textemdash}movement, reproduction and consumption{\textemdash}strongly affect consumer{\textendash}resource interactions in patchy environments. By very general arguments, the relative magnitudes of these three mechanisms are quantified by three non-dimensional ecological indices: the Frost, Strathmann and Lessard numbers. Qualitative analysis based on these ecological indices provides a basis for conjectures concerning the expected characteristics of organisms, species interactions and ecosystems in patchy environments.},

  abstract = {Significance             At the microscopic scales at which the life of marine microbes unfolds, the physics is dominated by viscosity. Increasing viscosity slows down both the passive transport of solutes and particles and the swimming of motile microorganisms, and thus directly or indirectly affects all aspects of microbial life. Viscosity depends not only on the physical properties of water, but it also varies as a consequence of biological activity, allowing microorganisms some control over their physical landscape. Our use of microrheology allows us to explore how viscosity is structured around phytoplankton cells and marine aggregates and unveils a level of spatial heterogeneity that has implications for the functioning of the microbial food web and hence of marine biogeochemical cycles.           ,              Microbial activity in planktonic systems creates a dynamic and heterogeneous microscale seascape that harbors a diverse community of microorganisms and ecological interactions of global significance. In recent decades great effort has been put into understanding this complex system, particularly focusing on the role of chemical patchiness, while overlooking a physical parameter that governs microbial life and is affected by biological activity: viscosity. Here we reveal spatial heterogeneity of viscosity in planktonic systems by using microrheological techniques that allow measurement of viscosity at length scales relevant to microorganisms. We show the viscous nature and the spatial extent of the phycosphere, the region surrounding phytoplankton. In {$\sim$}45\% of the phytoplankton cells analyzed we detected increases in viscosity that extended up to 30 {\textmu}m away from the cell with up to 40 times the viscosity of seawater. We also show how these gradients of viscosity can be amplified around a lysing phytoplankton cell as its viscous contents leak away. Finally, we report conservative estimates of viscosity inside marine aggregates, hotspots of microbial activity, more than an order of magnitude higher than in seawater. Since the diffusivities of dissolved molecules, particles, and microorganisms are inversely related to viscosity, microheterogeneity in viscosity alters the microscale distribution of microorganisms and their resources, with pervasive implications for the functioning of the planktonic ecosystem. Increasing viscosities impacts ecological interactions and processes, such as nutrient uptake, chemotaxis, and particle encounter, that occur at the microscale but influence carbon and nutrient cycles at a global scale.},

In other areas, chiefly the ability of microorganisms to take up nutrients and sense hydromechanical signals, our understanding will benefit from reinvigorated interest, and ample opportunities for breakthroughs exist.

The simulations reveal that ST2 exhibits anomalous scattering, reminiscent of that observed in experiment, which is characterised by an increase in the static structure factor at low wavenumbers. This unusual behaviour in ST2 is linked with coupled fluctuations in density and local tetrahedral order in the liquid. The Ornstein{\textendash}Zernike correlation length estimated from the anomalous scattering component exhibits power-law growth upon cooling, consistent with the existence of a liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point (LLCP) in the ST2 model at ca. 245 K. Further, spontaneous liquid{\textendash}liquid phase separation is observed upon thermally quenching a large system with 256,000 water molecules below the predicted critical temperature into the two-phase region. The large-scale MD simulations therefore confirm the existence of a metastable liquid{\textendash}liquid phase transition in ST2 and support findings from previous computational studies performed using smaller systems containing only a few hundred molecules.

In addition, it demonstrates how RODEs are being used in the biological sciences, where non-Gaussian and bounded noise are often more realistic than the Gaussian white noise in stochastic differential equations (SODEs). RODEs are used in many important applications and play a fundamental role in the theory of random dynamical systems. They can be analyzed pathwise with deterministic calculus, but require further treatment beyond that of classical ODE theory due to the lack of smoothness in their time variable. Although classical numerical schemes for ODEs can be used pathwise for RODEs, they rarely attain their traditional order since the solutions of RODEs do not have sufficient smoothness to have Taylor expansions in the usual sense. However, Taylor-like expansions can be derived for RODEs using an iterated application of the appropriate chain rule in integral form, and represent the starting point for the systematic derivation of consistent higher order numerical schemes for RODEs. The book is directed at a wide range of readers in applied and computational mathematics and related areas as well as readers who are interested in the applications of mathematical models involving random effects, in particular in the biological sciences.The level of this book is suitable for graduate students in applied mathematics and related areas, computational sciences and systems biology.

  abstract = {We review the recent research on supercooled and glassy water, focusing on the possible origins of its complex behavior. We stress the central role played by the strong directionality of the water{\textendash}water interaction and by the competition between local energy, local entropy, and local density. In this context we discuss the phenomenon of polyamorphism (i.e., the existence of more than one disordered solid state), emphasizing both the role of the preparation protocols and the transformation between the different disordered ices. Finally, we present the ongoing debate on the possibility of linking polyamorphism with a liquid{\textendash}liquid transition that could take place in the no-man's land, the temperature{\textendash}pressure window in which homogeneous nucleation prevents the investigation of water in its metastable liquid form.},

We show that, in such environments, physical limits on the accuracy of temporal gradient sensing govern when and where bacteria can accurately measure the cues they use to navigate. Chemical pulses are surrounded by a predictable dynamic region, outside which bacterial cells cannot resolve gradients above noise. The outer boundary of this region initially expands in proportion to the square root of time before rapidly contracting. Our analysis also reveals how chemokinesis{\textemdash}the increase in swimming speed many bacteria exhibit when absolute chemical concentration exceeds a threshold{\textemdash}may serve to enhance chemotactic accuracy and sensitivity when the chemical landscape is dynamic. More generally, our framework provides a rigorous method for partitioning bacteria into populations that are `near' and `far' from chemical hotspots in complex, rapidly evolving environments such as those that dominate aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Interactions among marine microbes primarily occur through exudation and sensing of dissolved chemical compounds, which ultimately control ecosystem-scale processes such as biomass production, nutrient cycling, carbon fixation, and remineralization. Prior to lysis, viruses alter host metabolism, stimulating the release of dissolved chemical cues from intact plankton. However, the nature and degree of interactions between prelysis, virus-infected cells and neighbouring microbes remain unquantified. Here, we determine the impact of viral infection on dissolved metabolite pools from the marine cyanobacterium             Synechococcus             and the subsequent chemotactic response of heterotrophic bacteria using time-resolved metabolomics and microfluidics. Metabolites released from intact, virus-infected             Synechococcus             elicited vigorous chemoattractive responses from heterotrophic bacteria (             Vibrio alginolyticus             and             Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis             ), with the strongest responses occurring in the early infection stages and following cell lysis. We provide the first experimental observations of sustained chemotaxis towards live, infected             Synechococcus             , which is contrasted by no discernible chemotaxis toward uninfected             Synechococcus             . Finally, metabolite compounds and concentrations driving chemotactic responses were identified using a novel high-throughput microfluidic device. Our findings establish that prior to cell lysis, virus-infected picophytoplankton release compounds that significantly attract motile heterotrophic bacteria, illustrating a viable mechanism for resource transfer to chemotactic bacteria with implications for our understanding of carbon and nutrient flux across trophic levels.},

  abstract = {Every form of behaviour is shaped by trial and error. Such stepwise adaptation can occur through individual learning or through natural selection, the basis of evolution. Since the work of Maynard Smith and others, it has been realised how game theory can model this process. Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centred not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioural programmes. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behaviour, and of the closely related interactions between species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions which can alter the basis of their success, i.e. to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions which punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms.},

The diffusion characteristics of this random walk remains unclear. In this study, by tracking the swimming of wild-type cells in a three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous environment, we found that their trajectories are superdiffusive, consistent with L{\'e}vy walk behavior. For comparison, we tracked the swimming of mutant cells that lack the chemotaxis signaling noise (the steady-state fluctuation of the concentration of the chemotaxis response regulator CheY-P) and found that their trajectories are normal diffusive. Therefore, wild-type               E. coli               cells explore the environment by L{\'e}vy walk, which originates from the chemotaxis signaling noise. This L{\'e}vy walk pattern enhances their efficiency in environmental exploration.

We further show that this L{\'e}vy walk behavior is due to the random fluctuation of the output level of the bacterial chemotaxis pathway, and it enhances the efficiency of the bacteria in exploring the environment.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Bacteria can chemotactically migrate up attractant gradients by controlling run-and-tumble motility patterns. In addition to this well-known chemotactic behaviour, several soil and marine bacterial species perform chemokinesis; they adjust their swimming speed according to the local concentration of chemoeffector, with higher speed at higher concentration. A field of attractant then induces a spatially varying swimming speed, which results in a drift towards lower attractant concentrations{\textemdash}contrary to the drift created by chemotaxis. Here, to explore the biological benefits of chemokinesis and investigate its impact on the chemotactic response, we extend a Keller{\textendash}Segel-type model to include chemokinesis. We apply the model to predict the dynamics of bacterial populations capable of chemokinesis and chemotaxis in chemoeffector fields inspired by microfluidic and agar plate migration assays. We find that chemokinesis combined with chemotaxis not only may enhance the population response with respect to pure chemotaxis, but also modifies it qualitatively. We conclude presenting predictions for bacteria around dynamic finite-size nutrient sources, simulating, e.g. a marine particle or a root. We show that chemokinesis can reduce the measuring bias that is created by a decaying attractant gradient.                                         Graphic abstract},

Our approach combines topology-based structural transformation coordinates, state-of-the-art free-energy calculation methods, and extensive unbiased molecular dynamics. All our diverse simulations cannot detect any barrier, within the investigated timescales and system size, for a discontinuous transition between the LDL and HDL forms throughout the so-called "no man's land", until the onset of the solid, non-diffusive amorphous forms.},

An analysis of the density, {$\rho$}, compressibility, {$\beta$}, heat capacity, Cp, and thermal conductivity, {$\kappa$}, of water over a monotonic (continuous) path bridging this data gap shows the following: (i) Such a path between {$\rho$}water at 320 K and {$\rho$}HDA yields an untenable thermal expansion coefficient of water. (ii) There is neither a continuous path between {$\beta$}water at 353 K and {$\beta$}HDA, nor between Cp,water at 363 K and Cp,HDA. (iii) The same value of {$\rho$}water, of {$\beta$}water, or of Cp,water at two temperatures separated by a maxima or a minima is incompatible with the HDL-LDL fluctuations view. (iv) {$\kappa$}LDA at {$\sim$}140 K is about twice that of {$\kappa$} water at 253 K. (v) {$\kappa$}HDA at 120 K is incompatible with {$\kappa$}water at T {$>$} 320 K. Thus, there is an internal inconsistency between the thermodynamics of HDA seen as a glass and that of water seen as an HDL-LDL mixture, which is incompatible with both the HDL-LDL fluctuations view and the liquid-liquid transition.},

  abstract = {Intensity-based time-lapse fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy has been a major tool for investigating cellular processes, converting otherwise unobservable molecular interactions into fluorescence time series. However, inferring the molecular interaction dynamics from the observables remains a challenging inverse problem, particularly when measurement noise and photobleaching are nonnegligible{\textemdash}a common situation in single-cell analysis. The conventional approach is to process the time-series data algebraically, but such methods inevitably accumulate the measurement noise and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting the scope of FRET microscopy. Here, we introduce an alternative probabilistic approach, B-FRET, generally applicable to standard 3-cube FRET-imaging data. Based on Bayesian filtering theory, B-FRET implements a statistically optimal way to infer molecular interactions and thus drastically improves the SNR. We validate B-FRET using simulated data and then apply it to real data, including the notoriously noisy in~vivo FRET time series from individual bacterial cells to reveal signaling dynamics otherwise hidden in the noise.},

  abstract = {This paper opens a series of papers aimed at finalizing the development of the lattice Boltzmann method for complex hydrodynamic systems. The lattice Boltzmann method is introduced at the elementary level of the linear advection equation. Details are provided on lifting the target macroscopic equations to a kinetic equation, and, after that, to the fully discrete lattice Boltzmann scheme. The over-relaxation method is put forward as a cornerstone of the second-order temporal discretization, and its enhancement with the use of the entropy estimate is explained in detail. A new asymptotic expansion of the entropy estimate is derived, and implemented in the sample code. It is shown that the lattice Boltzmann method provides a computationally efficient way of numerically solving the advection equation with a controlled amount of numerical dissipation, while retaining positivity.},

  abstract = {We present in vivo single-cell FRET measurements in the Escherichia coli chemotaxis system that reveal pervasive signaling variability, both across cells in isogenic populations and within individual cells over time. We quantify cell-to-cell variability of adaptation, ligand response, as well as steady-state output level, and analyze the role of network design in shaping this diversity from gene expression noise. In the absence of changes in gene expression, we find that single cells demonstrate strong temporal fluctuations. We provide evidence that such signaling noise can arise from at least two sources: (i) stochastic activities of adaptation enzymes, and (ii) receptor-kinase dynamics in the absence of adaptation. We demonstrate that under certain conditions, (ii) can generate giant fluctuations that drive signaling activity of the entire cell into a stochastic two-state switching regime. Our findings underscore the importance of molecular noise, arising not only in gene expression but also in protein networks.           ,              Many sophisticated computer programs use random number generators to help solve challenging problems. These problems range from achieving secure communication across the Internet to deciding how best to invest in the stock market. Much research in recent years has found that randomness is also widespread in living cells, where it is often called ``noise''. For example, the activity of some genes is so unpredictable to the extent that it appears random. Yet, relatively little is known about how such gene-expression noise propagates up to change how the cell behaves. Many open questions also remain about how cells might exploit these or other fluctuations to achieve complex tasks, like people use random number generators.             Bacteria perform a number of complex tasks. Some bacteria will swim toward chemicals that suggest a potential reward, such as food. Yet they swim away from chemicals that could lead them to harm. This ability is called chemotaxis and it relies on a network of interacting enzymes and other proteins that coordinates a bacterium's movements with the input from its senses.             Keegstra et al. set out to find sources of noise that might act as random number generators and help the bacterium E. coli to best perform chemotaxis. An improved version of a technique called in vivo F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (or in vivo FRET for short) was used to give a detectable signal when two proteins involved in the chemotaxis network interacted inside a single bacterium. The experiments showed that this protein network amplifies gene-expression noise for some genes while lessening it for others. In addition, the interactions between proteins encoded by genes acted as an extra source of noise, even when gene-expression noise was eliminated.             Keegstra et al. found that the amount of signaling within the chemotaxis network, as measured by in vivo FRET, varied wildly over time. This revealed two sources of noise at the level of protein signaling. One was due to randomness in the activity of the enzymes involved in tuning the cell's sensitivity to changes in its environment. The other was due to protein interactions within a large complex that acts as the cell's sensor. Unexpectedly, this second source of noise under some conditions could be so strong that it flipped the output of the cell's signaling network back and forth between just two states: ``on'' and ``off''.             Together these findings uncover how signaling networks can not only amplify or lessen gene-expression noise, but can themselves become a source of random events. The new knowledge of how such random events interact with a complex trait in a living cell {\textendash} namely chemotaxis {\textendash} could aid future antimicrobial strategies, because many bacteria use chemotaxis to help them establish infections. More generally, the new insights about noise in protein networks could help engineers seeking to build synthetic biochemical networks or produce useful compounds in living cells.},

Currently, the production of microalgal fucoxanthin is not yet feasible from an economic perspective. However, the cultivation of microalgae at favourable conditions holds great potential to increase the viability of this fucoxanthin source. Hence, this study aimed to review the fucoxanthin production of microalgae under different conditions systematically. A literature search was performed using the Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed databases. A total of 188 articles were downloaded and 28 articles were selected for the current review by two independent authors. Microalgae appeared to be a more reliable fucoxanthin source compared to macroalgae. Overall, a consensus fucoxanthin production condition was obtained and proposed: light intensity ranging from 10 to 100 {\textmu}mol/m2/s could achieve a higher fucoxanthin content. However, the optimal light condition in producing fucoxanthin is species-specific. The current review serves as an antecedent by offering insights into the fucoxanthin-producing microalgae response to different culture factors via a systematic analysis. With the current findings and recommendations, the feasibility of producing fucoxanthin commercially could be enhanced and possibly achieve practical and sustainable fucoxanthin production.},

  abstract = {The slow dynamics of glass-forming liquids is generally ascribed to the cage jump motion. In the cage jump picture, a molecule remains in a cage formed by neighboring molecules and, after a sufficiently long time, it jumps to escape from the original position by cage breaking. The clarification of the cage jump motion is therefore linked to unraveling the fundamental element of the slow dynamics. Here, we develop a cage jump model for the dynamics of supercooled water. The caged and jumping states of a water molecule are introduced with respect to the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) rearrangement process and describe the motion in supercooled states. It is then demonstrated from the molecular dynamics simulation of the TIP4P/2005 model that the characteristic length and time scales of cage jump motions provide a good description of the self-diffusion constant that is determined in turn from the long-time behavior of the mean square displacement. Our cage jump model thus enables the connection between H-bond dynamics and molecular diffusivity.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Quantifying the rate at which bacteria colonize aggregates is a key to understanding microbial turnover of aggregates. We used encounter models based on random walk and advection-diffusion considerations to predict colonization rates from the bacteria's motility patterns (swimming speed, tumbling frequency, and turn angles) and the hydrodynamic environment (stationary versus sinking aggregates). We then experimentally tested the models with 10 strains of bacteria isolated from marine particles: two strains were nonmotile; the rest were swimming at 20 to 60 {$\mu$}m s               -1               with different tumbling frequency (0 to 2 s               -1               ). The rates at which these bacteria colonized artificial aggregates (stationary and sinking) largely agreed with model predictions. We report several findings. (i) Motile bacteria rapidly colonize aggregates, whereas nonmotile bacteria do not. (ii) Flow enhances colonization rates. (iii) Tumbling strains colonize aggregates enriched with organic substrates faster than unenriched aggregates, while a nontumbling strain did not. (iv) Once on the aggregates, the bacteria may detach and typical residence time is about 3 h. Thus, there is a rapid exchange between attached and free bacteria. (v) With the motility patterns observed, freely swimming bacteria will encounter an aggregate in {$<$}1 day at typical upper-ocean aggregate concentrations. This is faster than even starving bacteria burn up their reserves, and bacteria may therefore rely solely on aggregates for food. (vi) The net result of colonization and detachment leads to a predicted equilibrium abundance of attached bacteria as a function of aggregate size, which is markedly different from field observations. This discrepancy suggests that inter- and intraspecific interactions among bacteria and between bacteria and their predators may be more important than colonization in governing the population dynamics of bacteria on natural aggregates.},

  abstract = {As the closest unicellular relatives of animals, choanoflagellates serve as useful model organisms for understanding the evolution of animal multicellularity. An important factor in animal evolution was the increasing ocean oxygen levels in the Precambrian, which are thought to have influenced the emergence of complex multicellular life. As a first step in addressing these conditions, we study here the response of the colony-forming choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta to oxygen gradients. Using a microfluidic device that allows spatio-temporal variations in oxygen concentrations, we report the discovery that S. rosetta displays positive aerotaxis. Analysis of the spatial population distributions provides evidence for logarithmic sensing of oxygen, which enhances sensing in low oxygen neighborhoods. Analysis of search strategy models on the experimental colony trajectories finds that choanoflagellate aerotaxis is consistent with stochastic navigation, the statistics of which are captured using an effective continuous version based on classical run-and-tumble chemotaxis.           ,              Most animals are made up of millions of cells, yet all animals evolved from ancestors that spent their whole lives as single cells. Today the closest single-celled relatives of animals are a group of aquatic organisms called choanoflagellates. Certain species of choanoflagellates can also form swimming colonies. This kind of multicellularity might resemble that seen in the earliest of animals. As such, studies into modern-day choanoflagellates can give insights into how the first animals to evolve might have behaved.             Many organisms can find their way towards favorable areas using different strategies. For instance, bacteria can bias their tumbling to gradually swim towards food, and algae can turn and move directly towards light. While choanoflagellates require oxygen, it was not known if they could also actively navigate towards it, or any other resource.             Now, Kirkegaard et al. find that the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta can indeed navigate towards oxygen {\textendash} an ability called aerotaxis. This was true for both individual cells and for colonies made up of many cells. This discovery suggests that the transition from living as a single cell to living as a simple multicellular organism could still have allowed the earliest animals to seek out and move towards resource-rich areas.             Aerotaxis requires cells to both sense oxygen and react appropriately to changes in its concentration. Kirkegaard et al. watched choanoflagellate colonies swimming under controlled conditions and varied the oxygen concentration in the water over time. These experiments revealed that the colonies navigate based on the logarithm of the oxygen concentration, so that at low oxygen levels the cells were even more sensitive to small changes in oxygen concentration. This type of `logarithmic sensing' is similar to how our ears sense sounds and our eyes sense light. Kirkegaard et al. went on to conclude that the colonies were not actively steering in the correct direction directly. Instead, the colonies appeared to choose directions at random and later decide whether such a turn was correct.             It remains unclear whether the common ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates could also perform aerotaxis, and if so what mechanisms this involved. Further studies to compare aerotaxis and aerotaxis-related genes in simple animals and other single-celled relatives of animals would be needed to illuminate this. Future studies could also explore the maximum and minimum oxygen concentrations that choanoflagellates can detect, and how well they navigate at these upper and lower limits.},

We investigated the structural transformations of transiently heated supercooled water films, which evolved for several nanoseconds per pulse during fast laser heating before quenching to 70 kelvin (K). Water's structure relaxed from its initial configuration to a steady-state configuration before appreciable crystallization. Over the full temperature range investigated, all structural changes were reversible and reproducible by a linear combination of high- and low-temperature structural motifs. The fraction of the liquid with the high-temperature motif decreased rapidly as the temperature decreased from 245 to 190 K, consistent with the predictions of two-state ``mixture'' models for supercooled water in the supercritical regime.},

  abstract = {The origin of water's anomalous properties has been debated for decades. Resolution of the problem is hindered by a lack of experimental data in a crucial region of temperatures,               T               , and pressures where supercooled water rapidly crystallizes{\textemdash}a region often referred to as ``no man's land.'' A recently developed technique where water is heated and cooled at rates greater than 10               9               K/s now enables experiments in this region. Here, it is used to investigate the structural relaxation and crystallization of deeply supercooled water for 170 K {$<$}               T               {$<$} 260 K. Water's relaxation toward a new equilibrium structure depends on its initial structure with hyperquenched glassy water (HQW) typically relaxing more quickly than low-density amorphous solid water (LDA). For HQW and               T               {$>$} 230 K, simple exponential relaxation kinetics is observed. For HQW at lower temperatures, increasingly nonexponential relaxation is observed, which is consistent with the dynamics expected on a rough potential energy landscape. For LDA, approximately exponential relaxation is observed for               T               {$>$} 230 K and               T               {$<$} 200 K, with nonexponential relaxation only at intermediate temperatures. At all temperatures, water's structure can be reproduced by a linear combination of two, local structural motifs, and we show that a simple model accounts for the complex kinetics within this context. The relaxation time,               {$\tau$}                                rel                              , is always shorter than the crystallization time,               {$\tau$}                                xtal                              .

Turbulent flows mix sperm and egg cells up to the millimeter scale; below this, active swimming and chemotaxis become important. Previous work addressed either turbulent mixing or chemotaxis in still water. Here, we present a general theory of sperm chemotaxis inside the smallest eddies of turbulent flow, where signaling molecules released by egg cells are spread into thin concentration filaments. Sperm cells `surf' along these filaments towards the egg. External flows make filaments longer, but also thinner. These opposing effects set an optimal flow strength. The optimum predicted by our theory matches flow measurements in shallow coastal waters. Our theory quantitatively agrees with two previous fertilization experiments in Taylor-Couette chambers and provides a mechanistic understanding of these early experiments. `Surfing along concentration filaments' could be a paradigm for navigation in complex environments in the presence of turbulent flow.},

Growth in medium with 1{$\cdot$}5{$\mkern1mu\%$} NaCl gave a higher response than growth with 3{$\mkern1mu\%$} NaCl; when the salinity of the chemotaxis buffer was raised, the chemotactic response was reduced. The role of starvation was also studied;               V. anguillarum               showed a high chemotactic response after starvation for 2 and 8\hspace{0.25em}days. Motility and chemotaxis are important virulence factors for this bacterium. Not only was the ability to perform chemotactic motility maintained after starvation, but also it was shown that starvation does not interfere with the ability of the organism to cause infection in rainbow trout after a bath challenge. The swimming speed was reduced at lower temperatures. Within the range of salinity and starvation studied, the motile cells swam with the same velocity, indicating that               V. anguillarum               under all the examined conditions has a functional flagellum and rotates it with constant speed. Phenamil, a specific inhibitor of Na               +               -driven flagella, reduced the motility of both starved and non-starved cells of               V. anguillarum               indicating that, in both cases, a Na               +               motive force drives the flagellum.},

However, their impact remains largely unquantified. Here we describe the sophisticated foraging strategy of a widespread mixotrophic dinoflagellate, involving the production of carbon-rich `mucospheres' that attract, capture, and immobilise microbial prey facilitating their consumption. We provide a detailed characterisation of this previously undescribed behaviour and reveal that it represents an overlooked, yet quantitatively significant mechanism for oceanic carbon fluxes. Following feeding, the mucospheres laden with surplus prey are discarded and sink, contributing an estimated 0.17{\textendash}1.24\,mg\,m               -2               d               -1               of particulate organic carbon, or 0.02{\textendash}0.15 Gt to the biological pump annually, which represents 0.1{\textendash}0.7\% of the estimated total export from the euphotic zone.

  abstract = {The putative liquid{\textendash}liquid phase transition in supercooled water has been used to explain many anomalous behaviors of water. However, no direct experimental verification of such a phase transition has been accomplished, and theoretical studies from different simulations contradict each other. We investigated the putative liquid{\textendash}liquid phase transition using the Water potential from Adaptive Force Matching for Ice and Liquid (WAIL). The simulation reveals a first-order phase transition in the supercooled regime with the critical point at {$\sim$}207 K and 50 MPa. Normal water is high-density liquid (HDL). Low-density liquid (LDL) emerges at lower temperatures. The LDL phase has a density only slightly larger than that of the ice-Ih and shows more long-range order than HDL. However, the transformation from LDL to HDL is spontaneous across the first-order phase transition line, suggesting the LDL configuration is not poorly formed nanocrystalline ice. It has been demonstrated in the past that the WAIL potential provides reliable predictions of water properties such as melting temperature and temperature of maximum density. Compared with other simple water potentials, WAIL is not biased by fitting to experimental properties, and simulation with this potential reflects the prediction of a high-quality first-principle potential energy surface.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have provided conclusive evidence for the existence of a liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point in numerical models of water. Such a scenario implies the competition between two local molecular arrangements of different densities: a high-density liquid (HDL) and a low-density liquid (LDL). Within this context, the development of accurate structural indicators to properly characterize the two interconverting local structures is demanded. In a previous study, we introduced a reliable energy-based structural descriptor that properly discriminates water molecules into tetrahedrally arranged molecules (T molecules) and distorted molecules (D molecules). The latter constitute defects in terms of hydrogen bond (HB) coordination and have been shown to represent a minority component, even at high temperatures above the melting point. In addition, the D molecules tend to form high-quality HBs with three T molecules and to be surrounded by T and D molecules at further distances. Thus, it became evident that, while the LDL state might consist of a virtually pure T state, the HDL state would comprise mixed molecular arrangements including the D molecules. Such a need to abandon the single-molecule description requires the investigation of the degree of structural information to be incorporated in order to build an appropriate multi-molecule indicator. Hence, in this work, we shall study the effect of the local structural constraints on the water molecules in order to discriminate the different molecular arrangements into two disjoint classes. This will enable us to build a multi-molecule structural indicator for water whose performance will then be investigated within the water's supercooled regime.},

Because existing methods to determine load, such as serial dilution plating, quantitative PCR, and whole metagenome sequencing add substantial cost and/or experimental burden, they are only rarely paired with amplicon sequencing. We introduce host-associated microbe PCR (hamPCR), a robust strategy to both quantify microbial load and describe interkingdom microbial community composition in a single amplicon library. We demonstrate its accuracy across multiple study systems, including nematodes and major crops, and further present a cost-saving technique to reduce host overrepresentation in the library prior to sequencing. Because hamPCR provides an accessible experimental solution to the well-known limitations and statistical challenges of compositional data, it has far-reaching potential in culture-independent microbiology.},

  abstract = {We perform molecular dynamics simulations with the TIP4P/Ice water model to characterize the relationship between dynamics and thermodynamics of liquid water in the supercooled region. We calculate the relevant properties of the phase diagram, and we find that TIP4P/Ice presents a retracing line of density maxima, similar to what was previously found for atomistic water models and models of other tetrahedral liquids. For this model, a liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid was recently found. We compute the lines of the maxima of isothermal compressibility and the minima of the coefficient of thermal expansion in the one phase region, and we show that these lines point to the liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point while collapsing on the Widom line. This line is the line of the maxima of correlation length that emanates from a second order critical point in the one phase region. Supercooled water was found to follow mode coupling theory and to undergo a transition from a fragile to a strong behavior right at the crossing of the Widom line. We find here that this phenomenology also happens for TIP4P/Ice. Our results appear, therefore, to be a general characteristic of supercooled water, which does not depend on the interaction potential used, and they reinforce the idea that the dynamical crossover from a region where the relaxation mechanism is dominated by cage relaxation to a region where cages are frozen and hopping dominates is correlated in water to a phase transition between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid.},

Yet, imaging systems capable of accomplishing these tasks are economically unattainable for most academic and teaching laboratories around the world. Here, we propose the Picroscope, which is the first low-cost system for simultaneous longitudinal biological imaging made primarily using off-the-shelf and 3D-printed materials. The Picroscope is compatible with standard 24-well cell culture plates and captures 3D z-stack image data. The Picroscope can be controlled remotely, allowing for automatic imaging with minimal intervention from the investigator. Here, we use this system in a range of applications. We gathered longitudinal whole organism image data for frogs, zebrafish, and planaria worms. We also gathered image data inside an incubator to observe 2D monolayers and 3D mammalian tissue culture models. Using this tool, we can measure the behavior of entire organisms or individual cells over long-time periods.},

A sudden decrease elicits the tumbling response observed with spatial gradients; it was found, however, that a sudden increase also elicits a response, namely supercoordinated swimming. This demonstrates that chemotaxis is achieved by modulation of the incidence of tumbling both above and below its steady-state value. The initial responses gradually revert to the steady-state motility pattern characteristic of a uniform distribution of attractant. The apparent detection of a spatial gradient by the bacteria therefore involves an actual detection of a temporal gradient experienced as a result of movement through space. Potential models for the chemotactic response based on some ``memory'' mechanism are discussed.},

Here, we present a theory that fully specifies, without any adjustable parameters, the optimal design of a canonical sensing system in terms of two elementary design principles: (1) there exists an optimal integration time, which is determined by the input statistics and the number of receptors; and (2) in the optimally designed system, the number of independent concentration measurements as set by the number of receptors and the optimal integration time equals the number of readout molecules that store these measurements and equals the work to store these measurements reliably; no resource is then in excess and hence wasted. Applying our theory to the               Escherichia coli               chemotaxis system indicates that its integration time is not only optimal for sensing shallow gradients but also necessary to enable navigation in these gradients.},

Our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the variability in phytoplankton size structure has been shaped by the assumption that the pace of metabolism decreases allometrically with increasing cell size. However, recent field and laboratory evidence indicates that biomass-specific production and growth rates are similar in both small and large cells but peak at intermediate cell sizes. The maximum nutrient uptake rate scales isometrically with cell volume and superisometrically with the minimum nutrient quota. The unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from ataxonomic, size-dependent trade-off processes related to nutrient requirement, acquisition, and use. The superior ability of intermediate-size cells to exploit high nutrient concentrations explains their biomass dominance during blooms. Biogeographic patterns in phytoplankton size structure and growth rate are independent of temperature and driven mainly by changes in resource supply.},

The distances to the first coordination shell for low-, high-, and very-high-density amorphous ice (LDA, HDA, VHDA) were determined to be 2.75, 2.78, and 2.80 {\AA}, respectively, with high accuracy due to measurements up to a large momentum transfer of 23 {\AA}-1.

Specifically, we simulate{\textemdash}via classical molecular dynamics simulations{\textemdash}the isobaric cooling of a sample composed of 512 water molecules from ambient to deeply undercooled conditions at three pressures, namely, 1 bar, 400 bars, and 1000 bars. In correspondence with the Widom line (WL), (i) the HDL-like dominating cluster undergoes fragmentation caused by the percolation of LDL-like aggregates following a spinodal-like kinetics; (ii) such fragmentation always occurs at a ``critical'' concentration of {$\sim$}20\%{\textendash}30\% in LDL; (iii) the HBN within LDL-like environments is characterized by an equal number of pentagonal and hexagonal rings that create a state of maximal frustration between a configuration that promotes crystallization (hexagonal ring) and a configuration that hinders it (pentagonal ring); (iv) the spatial organization of HDL-like environments shows a marked variation. Moreover, the inspection of the global symmetry shows that the intermediate-range order decreases in correspondence with the WL and such a decrease becomes more pronounced upon increasing the pressure, hence supporting the hypothesis of a liquid-liquid critical point. Our results reveal and rationalize the complex microscopic origin of water's anomalies as the cooperative effect of several factors acting synergistically. Beyond implications for water, our findings may be extended to other materials displaying anomalous behaviours.},

  abstract = {Collective behaviors require coordination among a group of individuals. As a result, individuals that are too phenotypically different from the rest of the group can be left out, reducing heterogeneity, but increasing coordination. If individuals also reproduce, the offspring can have different phenotypes from their parent(s). This raises the question of how these two opposing processes{\textemdash}loss of diversity by collective behaviors and generation of it through growth and inheritance{\textemdash}dynamically shape the phenotypic composition of an isogenic population. We examine this question theoretically using collective migration of chemotactic bacteria as a model system, where cells of different swimming phenotypes are better suited to navigate in different environments. We find that the differential loss of phenotypes caused by collective migration is environment-dependent. With cell growth, this differential loss enables migrating populations to dynamically adapt their phenotype compositions to the environment, enhancing migration through multiple environments. Which phenotypes are produced upon cell division depends on the level of nongenetic inheritance, and higher inheritance leads to larger composition adaptation and faster migration at steady state. However, this comes at the cost of slower responses to new environments. Due to this trade-off, there is an optimal level of inheritance that maximizes migration speed through changing environments, which enables a diverse population to outperform a nondiverse one. Growing populations might generally leverage the selection-like effects provided by collective behaviors to dynamically shape their own phenotype compositions, without mutations.},

Infinite series expansions in a single index n are obtained for the sink reaction rate and reactant concentration profiles using the bispherical expansion. Each of the coefficients, generated exactly by a matrix elimination method, is expressed in terms of nested, continued fractions easily evaluated for the given n. At intermediate and larger sink{\textendash}source separation distances the sink reaction rate decays harmonically. For smaller sink{\textendash}source separations with a highly reactive small sink, a local maximum in the sink reaction rate is found.},

The majority of molecules are tetrahedrally coordinated (T molecules), via low-energy hydrogen bonds. The minority component, whose relative concentration decreases with a decrease in the temperature at constant pressure, is characterized by prevalently three-coordinated molecules, giving rise to a distorted local network around them (D molecules). The inter-conversion between T and D molecules explains the increasing specific heat at constant pressure on cooling. The local structure around a T molecule resembles the one found experimentally in low-density amorphous ice (a network structure mostly composed by T molecules), while the local structure around a D molecule is reminiscent of the structural properties of high-density amorphous ice (a network structure composed by a mixture of T and D molecules).},

Understanding of small-scale microbial processes associated with phytoplankton colonies and aggregates is therefore crucial for understanding large-scale biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Phytoplankton colonies and sinking aggregates are characterized by steep concentration gradients of gases and nutrients in their interior. Here, we present a mechanistic mathematical model designed to perform modeling of small-scale fluxes and evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological constraints of processes that co-occur in phytoplankton colonies and sinking porous aggregates. The model accurately reproduced empirical measurements of O               2               concentrations and fluxes measured in sinking aggregates. Common theoretical assumptions of either constant concentration or constant flux over the entire surface did not apply to sinking aggregates. Consequently, previous theoretical models overestimate O               2               flux in these aggregates by as high as 15-fold.},

Often, this task is strongly impacted by data consisting of trajectories with short length (either due to brief recordings or previous trajectory segmentation) and limited localization precision. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method based on a random forest architecture, which is able to associate single trajectories to the underlying diffusion mechanism with high accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is able to determine the anomalous exponent with a small error, thus inherently providing a classification of the motion as normal or anomalous (sub- or super-diffusion). The method provides highly accurate outputs even when working with very short trajectories and in the presence of experimental noise. We further demonstrate the application of transfer learning to experimental and simulated data not included in the training/test dataset. This allows for a full, high-accuracy characterization of experimental trajectories without the need of any prior information.},

The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers.},

  abstract = {A liquid{\textendash}liquid transition (LLT) in a single-component substance is an unconventional phase transition from one liquid to another. LLT has recently attracted considerable attention because of its fundamental importance in our understanding of the liquid state. To access the order parameter governing LLT from a microscopic viewpoint, here we follow the structural evolution during the LLT of an organic molecular liquid, triphenyl phosphite (TPP), by time-resolved small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements. We find that locally favored clusters, whose characteristic size is a few nanometers, are spontaneously formed and their number density monotonically increases during LLT. This strongly suggests that the order parameter of LLT is the number density of locally favored structures and of nonconserved nature. We also show that the locally favored structures are distinct from the crystal structure and these two types of orderings compete with each other. Thus, our study not only experimentally identifies the structural order parameter governing LLT, but also may settle a long-standing debate on the nature of the transition in TPP, i.e., whether the transition is LLT or merely microcrystal formation.},

A large-scale solenoid-type 3D mean flow field has been observed. The extraordinarily fast mixing process of the {$\mu$}EK turbulent mixer can be primarily attributed to two steps. First, under the strong velocity fluctuations generated by {$\mu$}EK mechanism, the two fluids with different conductivity are highly mixed near the entrance, primarily at the low electric conductivity sides and bias to the bottom wall. Then, the well-mixed fluid in the local region convects to the rest regions of the micromixer by the large-scale solenoid-type 3D mean flow. The mechanism of the large-scale 3D mean flow could be attributed to the unbalanced electroosmotic flows (EOFs) due to the high and low electric conductivity on both the bottom and top surface.},

  abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

How fragmentation affects populations depends on the rate at which individuals move between spatially separated patches. Whereas negative effects of habitat loss on biodiversity are well known, the effects of fragmentation               per se               on population dynamics and ecosystem stability remain less well understood. Here, we use a spatially explicit predator{\textendash}prey model to investigate how the interplay between fragmentation and optimal foraging behaviour affects predator{\textendash}prey interactions and, subsequently, ecosystem stability. We study systems wherein prey occupies isolated patches and are consumed by predators that disperse following L{\'e}vy random walks. Our results show that the L{\'e}vy exponent and the degree of fragmentation jointly determine coexistence probabilities. In highly fragmented landscapes, Brownian and ballistic predators go extinct and only scale-free predators can coexist with prey. Furthermore, our results confirm that predation causes irreversible habitat loss in fragmented landscapes owing to overexploitation of smaller patches of prey. Moreover, we show that predator dispersal can reduce, but not prevent or minimize, the amount of lost habitat. Our results suggest that integrating optimal foraging theory into population and landscape ecology is crucial to assessing the impact of fragmentation on biodiversity and ecosystem stability.},

Here we show that this liquid{\textendash}liquid phase transition in tetrahedral networks can be described as a transition between an unentangled, low-density liquid and an entangled, high-density liquid, the latter containing an ensemble of topologically complex motifs. We first reveal this distinction in a rationally designed colloidal analogue of water. We show that this colloidal water model displays the well-known water thermodynamic anomalies as well as a liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point. We then investigate water, employing two widely used molecular models, to demonstrate that there is also a clear topological distinction between its two supercooled liquid networks, thereby establishing the generality of this observation, which might have far-reaching implications for understanding liquid{\textendash}liquid phase transitions in tetrahedral liquids.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             From the homeostasis of human health to the cycling of Earth's elements, microbial activities underlie environmental, medical and industrial processes. These activities occur in chemical and physical landscapes that are highly dynamic and experienced by bacteria as fluctuations. In this review, we first discuss how bacteria can experience both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in their environments as temporal fluctuations of various timescales (seconds to seasons) and types (nutrient, sunlight, fluid flow, etc.). We then focus primarily on nutrient fluctuations to discuss how bacterial communities, populations and single cells respond to environmental fluctuations. Overall, we find that environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous and diverse, and strongly shape microbial behavior, ecology and evolution when compared with environments in which conditions remain constant over time. We hope this review may serve as a guide toward understanding the significance of environmental fluctuations in microbial life, such that their contributions and implications can be better assessed and exploited.},

Predicting the particulate carbon flux is therefore critical for understanding both global carbon cycling and the future climate. Microbes play a crucial role in particulate organic carbon degradation, but the impact of depth-dependent microbial dynamics on ocean-scale particulate carbon fluxes is poorly understood. Here we scale-up essential features of particle-associated microbial dynamics to understand the large-scale vertical carbon flux in the ocean. Our model provides mechanistic insight into the microbial contribution to the particulate organic carbon flux profile. We show that the enhanced transfer of carbon to depth can result from populations struggling to establish colonies on sinking particles due to diffusive nutrient loss, cell detachment, and mortality. These dynamics are controlled by the interaction between multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Accurately capturing particle-microbe interactions is essential for predicting variability in large-scale carbon cycling.},

Swimming motility is one of the costliest bacterial behaviors, but expression of motility genes nevertheless increases when bacteria grow slower on poor carbon sources. Here, we show that competitive fitness benefit provided by the ability of motile bacteria to follow gradients of secondary nutrients shows similar negative dependence on the growth rate as the investment in motility. Thus, bacteria appear to pre-invest into the motile behavior in proportion to the anticipated benefit that can be provided by chemotaxis when nutrient gradients become available in their environment.           ,                             Microorganisms possess diverse mechanisms to regulate investment into individual cellular processes according to their environment. How these regulatory strategies reflect the inherent trade-off between the benefit and cost of resource investment remains largely unknown, particularly for many cellular functions that are not immediately related to growth. Here, we investigate regulation of motility and chemotaxis, one of the most complex and costly bacterial behaviors, as a function of bacterial growth rate. We show with experiment and theory that in poor nutritional conditions,               Escherichia coli               increases its investment in motility in proportion to the reproductive fitness advantage provided by the ability to follow nutrient gradients. Since this growth-rate dependent regulation of motility genes occurs even when nutrient gradients are absent, we hypothesize that it reflects an anticipatory preallocation of cellular resources. Notably, relative fitness benefit of chemotaxis could be observed not only in the presence of imposed gradients of secondary nutrients but also in initially homogeneous bacterial cultures, suggesting that bacteria can generate local gradients of carbon sources and excreted metabolites, and subsequently use chemotaxis to enhance the utilization of these compounds. This interplay between metabolite excretion and their chemotaxis-dependent reutilization is likely to play an important general role in microbial communities.},

The composition and function of their communities are shaped by fundamental trade-offs between resource acquisition and predation risk. The flagellates gather resources by creating feeding currents by means of beating flagella, but the resulting fluid disturbance attracts flow-sensing predators, thus giving rise to a trade-off. Here we quantify this trade-off by visualizing the fluid flow that the foraging activity generates. We show that the flow architecture relates to the arrangement and beat kinematics of their flagella in characteristic ways that can be predicted qualitatively from simple fluid mechanical models.           ,              Unicellular flagellated protists are a key element in aquatic microbial food webs. They all use flagella to swim and to generate feeding currents to encounter prey and enhance nutrient uptake. At the same time, the beating flagella create flow disturbances that attract flow-sensing predators. Protists have highly diverse flagellar arrangements in terms of number of flagella and their position, beat pattern, and kinematics, but it is unclear how the various arrangements optimize the fundamental trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk. Here we describe the near-cell flow fields produced by 15 species and demonstrate consistent relationships between flagellar arrangement and swimming speed and between flagellar arrangement and flow architecture, and a trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk. The flow fields fall in categories that are qualitatively described by simple point force models that include the drag force of the moving cell body and the propulsive forces of the flagella. The trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk varies characteristically between flow architectures: Flagellates with multiple flagella have higher predation risk relative to their clearance rate compared to species with only one active flagellum, with the exception of the highly successful dinoflagellates that have simultaneously achieved high clearance rates and stealth behavior due to a unique flagellar arrangement. Microbial communities are shaped by trade-offs and environmental constraints, and a mechanistic explanation of foraging trade-offs is a vital part of understanding the eukaryotic communities that form the basis of pelagic food webs.},

We conducted a quantitative and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic multimethod investigation and analysis (X-ray absorption, X-ray emission, and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering). We find that all known X-ray spectroscopic observables can be fully and consistently described with continuous-distribution models of near-tetrahedral liquid water at ambient conditions with 1.74                                                   {$\pm$}                                               2.1\% donated and accepted H-bonds per molecule.                        ,                             The phase diagram of water harbors controversial views on underlying structural properties of its constituting molecular moieties, its fluctuating hydrogen-bonding network, as well as pair-correlation functions.

In liquid water, we extract the mean value of 1.74                                                   {$\pm$}                                               2.1\% donated and accepted hydrogen bonds per molecule, pointing to a continuous-distribution model. In addition, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with unprecedented energy resolution also supports continuous distribution of molecular neighborhoods within liquid water, as do X-ray emission spectra once the femtosecond scattering duration and proton dynamics in resonant X-ray{\textendash}matter interaction are taken into account. Thus, X-ray spectra of liquid water in ambient conditions can be understood without a two-structure model, whereas the occurrence of nanoscale-length correlations within the continuous distribution remains open.},

Despite this, surface-attached cells in biofilms are often portrayed as static and sluggish, a stark contrast to the energetic swimming they exhibit in liquid. Here we use microfluidic devices and automated cell tracking to challenge this view: We find that individual cells will actively move toward nutrients within a developing biofilm. This ability not only allows cells to seek out favored positions on a surface but our analyses show that they can regulate their movement with remarkable submicron precision. Our findings suggest we can systematically engineer biofilms by manipulating the movement of the cells from which they are founded.           ,                             Bacteria form surface-attached communities, known as biofilms, which are central to bacterial biology and how they affect us. Although surface-attached bacteria often experience strong chemical gradients, it remains unclear whether single cells can effectively perform chemotaxis on surfaces. Here we use microfluidic chemical gradients and massively parallel automated tracking to study the behavior of the pathogen               Pseudomonas aeruginosa               during early biofilm development. We show that individual cells can efficiently move toward chemoattractants using pili-based ``twitching'' motility and the Chp chemosensory system. Moreover, we discovered the behavioral mechanism underlying this surface chemotaxis: Cells reverse direction more frequently when moving away from chemoattractant sources. These corrective maneuvers are triggered rapidly, typically before a wayward cell has ventured a fraction of a micron. Our work shows that single bacteria can direct their motion with submicron precision and reveals the hidden potential for chemotaxis within bacterial biofilms.},

In the field, however, most prey can accurately assess predation risk by sensing predator chemical cues, which typically trigger some form of escape response to reduce the probability of capture. Here, we explore under laboratory-controlled conditions the long-term (minutes to hours) escaping response of the sea urchin                 Paracentrotus lividus                 , a key species in Mediterranean subtidal macrophyte communities.

We analysed individual sea urchin trajectories, computed their heading angles, speed, path straightness, diffusive properties, and directional entropy (as a measure of path unpredictability). To account for the full picture of escaping strategies, we followed not only the first instants post-predator exposure, but also the entire escape trajectory. We then used linear models to compare the observed results from control and predators treatments.                                                        Results               The trajectories from sea urchins subjected to predator cues were, on average, straighter and faster than those coming from controls, which translated into differences in the diffusive properties and unpredictability of their movement patterns. Sea urchins in control trials showed complex diffusive properties in an information-limited environment, with highly variable trajectories, ranging from Brownian motion to superdiffusion, and even marginal ballistic motion. In predator cue treatments, variability reduced, and trajectories became more homogeneous and predictable at the edge of ballistic motion.                                         Conclusions               Despite their old evolutionary origin, lack of cephalization, and homogenous external appearance, the trajectories that sea urchins displayed in information-limited environments were complex and ranged widely between individuals. Such variable behavioural repertoire appeared to be intrinsic to the species and emerged when the animals were left unconstrained. Our results highlight that fear from predators can be an important driver of sea urchin movement patterns. All in all, the observation of anomalous diffusion, highly variable trajectories and the behavioural shift induced by predator cues, further highlight that the functional forms currently used in classical predator{\textendash}prey models are far from realistic.},

The specific chemical structure of this pigment also leads to many functional activities in human health. They are outlined in this work and are supported by the latest studies in the literature. The scientific and industrial interest in fucoxanthin is correlated with great improvements in the development of algae cultures and downstream processes.

The use of bio-based solvents, aqueous two-phase systems and the centrifugal partition chromatography are the most promising processes.

  abstract = {There has been uninterrupted interest in supercooled water ever since the pioneering experiments of Speedy and Angell revealed sharp increases in this substance's response functions upon supercooling. One intriguing hypothesis that was formulated to explain this behavior involves the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid transition (LLT) at deeply supercooled conditions. The preponderance of experimental evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, although no definitive proof exists to date. Computational studies have played an important role in this area, because ice nucleation can in principle be controlled in silico. It has been claimed, controversially, that the LLT is a misinterpreted liquid-solid transition in all models of water. Recent studies disprove this viewpoint by providing unambiguous counter-examples of distinct liquid-liquid and liquid-crystal transitions in tetrahedral models. In one, state-of-theart sampling methods were used to compute the free energy surface of a molecular model of water and revealed the existence of two liquid phases in metastable equilibrium with each other and a stable crystal phase, at the same, deeply supercooled thermodynamic conditions. Further studies showed that, by tuning the potential parameters of a model tetrahedral system, it is possible to make the LLT evolve continuously from metastability to being thermodynamically stable with respect to crystallization. Most recently, it has been shown that the simulation code used to challenge the hypothesis of an LLT contains conceptual errors that invalidate the results on which the challenge was based, definitively resolving the controversy. The debate has vastly expanded the range of fundamental questions being pursued about phase transitions in metastable systems and ushered the use of increasingly sophisticated computational methods to explore the possible existence of LLTs in model systems.},

The module comprises several programs written in general-purpose programming language Julia designed for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science. The paper explains various concepts related to spatial and temporal discretization, explicit and implicit numerical schemes, multi-step numerical schemes, higher-order shock-capturing numerical methods, and iterative solvers in CFD. These concepts are illustrated using the linear convection equation, the inviscid Burgers equation, and the two-dimensional Poisson equation. The paper covers finite difference implementation for equations in both conservative and non-conservative form. The paper also includes the development of one-dimensional solver for Euler equations and demonstrate it for the Sod shock tube problem. We show the application of finite difference schemes for developing two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes solvers with different boundary conditions applied to the lid-driven cavity and vortex-merger problems. At the end of this paper, we develop hybrid Arakawa-spectral solver and pseudo-spectral solver for two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we compare the computational performance of these minimalist fashion Navier-Stokes solvers written in Julia and Python.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Active fluids, like all other fluids, exert mechanical pressure on confining walls. Unlike equilibrium, this pressure is generally not a function of the fluid state in the bulk and displays some peculiar properties. For example, when activity is not uniform, fluid regions with different activity may exert different pressures on the container walls but they can coexist side by side in mechanical equilibrium. Here we show that by spatially modulating bacterial motility with light, we can generate active pressure gradients capable of transporting passive probe particles in controlled directions. Although bacteria swim faster in the brighter side, we find that bacteria in the dark side apply a stronger pressure resulting in a net drift motion that points away from the low activity region. Using a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we show that this drift originates mainly from an interaction pressure term that builds up due to the compression exerted by a layer of polarized cells surrounding the slow region. In addition to providing new insights into the generalization of pressure for interacting systems with non-uniform activity, our results demonstrate the possibility of exploiting active pressure for the controlled transport of microscopic objects.},

While many of the qualitative trends of water dynamical properties in the supercooled regime are well understood, the connections between the structure and dynamics of room temperature and supercooled water have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that the reorientational time scales and diffusion coefficients of supercooled water can be predicted from simulations of room temperature liquid water. Specifically, the derivatives of these dynamical time scales with respect to inverse temperature are directly calculated using the fluctuation theory applied to dynamics. These derivatives are used to predict the time scales and activation energies in the supercooled regime based on the temperature dependence in one of two forms: that based on the stability limit conjecture or assuming an equilibrium associated with a liquid{\textendash}liquid phase transition. The results indicate that the retarded dynamics of supercooled water originate from structures and mechanisms that are present in the liquid under ambient conditions.},

Quantitative understanding of how such diversity is generated and maintained in populations is, however, experimentally and theoretically challenging. We focus on the swimming behavior of               Escherichia coli               as a model system of phenotypic diversity and show that, despite temporal changes in behavior that each individual undergoes, significant differences between individuals persist throughout most of their lifetimes. While the behavior of even closely related bacteria can be remarkably different, the behavioral variations produced by nongenetic mechanisms are inherited across generations. The general experimental and theoretical framework developed here can be applied to study quantitative aspects of phenotypic diversity in many biological systems.                        ,                             Isogenic populations often display remarkable levels of phenotypic diversity even in constant, homogeneous environments. Such diversity results from differences between individuals (``nongenetic individuality'') as well as changes during individuals' lifetimes (``changeability''). Yet, studies that capture and quantify both sources of diversity are scarce. Here we measure the swimming behavior of hundreds of               Escherichia coli               bacteria continuously over two generations and use a model-independent method for quantifying behavior to show that the behavioral space of               E. coli               is low-dimensional, with variations occurring mainly along two independent and interpretable behavioral traits. By statistically decomposing the diversity in these two traits, we find that individuality is the main source of diversity, while changeability makes a smaller but significant contribution. Finally, we show that even though traits of closely related individuals can be remarkably different, they exhibit positive correlations across generations that imply nongenetic inheritance. The model-independent experimental and theoretical framework developed here paves the way for more general studies of microbial behavioral diversity.},

Sensing and motility noise imply trade-off choices between precision and accuracy. To gain insight into these trade-offs, we learn optimal chemotactic decision filters using supervised machine learning, applying support vector machines to a biologically motivated training dataset. We discuss how the optimal filter depends on the level of sensing and motility noise, and derive an empirical power law for the optimal measurement time                                                                                                                   with                                                                                                                   as a function of the rotational diffusion coefficient               D               rot               characterizing motility noise.

  abstract = {Abstract             Empty liquids represent a wide class of materials whose constituents arrange in a random network through reversible bonds. Many key insights on the physical properties of empty liquids have originated almost independently from the study of colloidal patchy particles on one side, and a large body of theoretical and experimental research on water on the other side. Patchy particles represent a family of coarse-grained potentials that allows for a precise control of both the geometric and the energetic aspects of bonding, while water has arguably the most complex phase diagram of any pure substance, and a puzzling amorphous phase behavior. It was only recently that the exchange of ideas from both fields has made it possible to solve long-standing problems and shed new light on the behavior of empty liquids. Here we highlight the connections between patchy particles and water, focusing on the modelling principles that make an empty liquid behave like water, including the factors that control the appearance of thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies, the possibility of liquid{\textendash}liquid phase transitions, and the crystallization of open crystalline structures.},

Interest in these methods has exploded in recent years, with numerous applications emerging in fields such as navigation, aerospace engineering, telecommunications and medicine. This compact, informal introduction for graduate students and advanced undergraduates presents the current state-of-the-art filtering and smoothing methods in a unified Bayesian framework. Readers learn what non-linear Kalman filters and particle filters are, how they are related, and their relative advantages and disadvantages. They also discover how state-of-the-art Bayesian parameter estimation methods can be combined with state-of-the-art filtering and smoothing algorithms. The book's practical and algorithmic approach assumes only modest mathematical prerequisites. Examples include Matlab computations, and the numerous end-of-chapter exercises include computational assignments. Matlab code is available for download at www.cambridge.org/sarkka, promoting hands-on work with the methods.},

  abstract = {Animal migration is highly sensitised to environmental cues, but plant dispersal is considered largely passive. The common dandelion,               Taraxacum officinale               , bears an intricate haired pappus facilitating flight. The pappus enables the formation of a separated vortex ring during flight; however, the pappus structure is not static but reversibly changes shape by closing in response to moisture. We hypothesised that this leads to changed dispersal properties in response to environmental conditions. Using wind tunnel experiments for flow visualisation, particle image velocimetry, and flight tests, we characterised the fluid mechanics effects of the pappus morphing. We also modelled dispersal to understand the impact of pappus morphing on diaspore distribution. Pappus morphing dramatically alters the fluid mechanics of diaspore flight. We found that when the pappus closes in moist conditions, the drag coefficient decreases and thus the falling velocity is greatly increased. Detachment of diaspores from the parent plant also substantially decreases. The change in detachment when the pappus closes increases dispersal distances by reducing diaspore release when wind speeds are low. We propose that moisture-dependent pappus-morphing is a form of informed dispersal allowing rapid responses to changing conditions.},

  abstract = {Global warming accelerates melting of glaciers and increases the supply of meltwater and associated inorganic particles, nutrients, and organic matter to adjacent coastal seas, but the ecosystem impact is poorly resolved and quantified. When meltwater is delivered by glacial rivers, the potential impact could be a reduction in light and nutrient availability for primary producers while supplying allochthonous carbon for heterotrophic processes, thereby tipping the net community metabolism toward heterotrophy. To test this hypothesis, we determined physical and biogeochemical parameters along a 110-km fjord transect in NE Greenland fjord, impacted by glacial meltwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet. The meltwater is delivered from glacier-fed river outlets in the inner parts of the fjord, creating a gradient in salinity and turbidity. The planktonic primary production was low, 20{\textendash}45 mg C m               -2               d               -1               , in the more turbid inner half of the fjord, increasing 10-fold to around 350 mg C m               -2               d               -1               in the shelf waters outside the fjord. Plankton community metabolism was measured at three stations, which displayed a transition from net heterotrophy in the inner fjord to net autotrophy in the coastal shelf waters. Respiration was significantly correlated to turbidity, with a 10-fold increase in the inner turbid part of the fjord. We estimated the changes in meltwater input and sea ice coverage in the area for the last 60 y. The long-term trend and the observed effects demonstrated the importance of freshwater runoff as a key driver of coastal ecosystem change in the Arctic with potential negative consequences for coastal productivity.},

Recent discovery of the high-spined tail of that skeleton, however, led to a bolder conjecture that               S. aegyptiacus               was the first fully aquatic dinosaur. The `aquatic hypothesis' posits that               S. aegyptiacus               was a slow quadruped on land but a capable pursuit predator in coastal waters, powered by an expanded tail. We test these functional claims with skeletal and flesh models of               S. aegyptiacus               . We assembled a CT-based skeletal reconstruction based on the fossils, to which we added internal air and muscle to create a posable flesh model. That model shows that on land               S. aegyptiacus               was bipedal and in deep water was an unstable, slow-surface swimmer ({$<$}1 m/s) too buoyant to dive. Living reptiles with similar spine-supported sails over trunk and tail are used for display rather than aquatic propulsion, and nearly all extant secondary swimmers have reduced limbs and fleshy tail flukes. New fossils also show that               Spinosaurus               ranged far inland. Two stages are clarified in the evolution of               Spinosaurus               , which is best understood as a semiaquatic bipedal ambush piscivore that frequented the margins of coastal and inland waterways.},

The functional role of DMSP is somewhat unclear, but it is degraded by marine bacteria as a source of reduced carbon and sulfur. It also acts as a foraging cue for a variety of aquatic animals ranging from copepods to marine mammals. Now,                                Seymour                 et al.

However, its role in the chemical ecology of marine planktonic microbes is largely unknown, and there is evidence for contradictory functions. By using microfluidics and image analysis of swimming behavior, we observed attraction toward microscale pulses of DMSP and related compounds among several motile strains of phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, and bacterivore and herbivore microzooplankton. Because microbial DMSP cycling is the main natural source of cloud-forming sulfur aerosols, our results highlight how adaptations to microscale chemical seascapes shape planktonic food webs, while potentially influencing climate at the global scale.},

  abstract = {The origin of water's anomalies has been a matter of long-standing debate. A two-state model, dating back to R{\"o}ntgen, relies on the dynamical coexistence of two types of local structures{\textemdash}locally favored tetrahedral structure (LFTS) and disordered normal-liquid structure (DNLS){\textemdash}in liquid water. Phenomenologically, this model not only explains water's thermodynamic anomalies but also can rationalize the existence of a liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point (LLCP) if there is a cooperative formation of LFTS. We recently found direct evidence for the coexistence of LFTS and DNLS in the experimental structure factor of liquid water. However, the existence of the LLCP and its impact on water's properties has remained elusive, leaving the origin of water's anomalies unclear. Here we propose a unique strategy to locate the LLCP of liquid water. First, we make a comprehensive analysis of a large set of experimental structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic data based on our hierarchical two-state model. This model predicts that the two thermodynamic and dynamical fluctuation maxima lines should cross at the LLCP if it exists, which we confirm by hundred-microsecond simulations for model waters. Based on recent experimental results of the compressibility and diffusivity measurements in the no man's land, we reveal that the two lines cross around 184 K and 173 MPa for real water, suggesting the presence of the LLCP around there. Nevertheless, we find that the criticality is almost negligible in the experimentally accessible region of liquid water because it is too far from the LLCP. Our findings would provide a clue to settle the long-standing debate.},

However, the unusual properties of liquid water, if compared with other liquids, has puzzled us for centuries because the basic structure of liquid water has remained unclear and has continued to be a matter of serious debate. Here, by computer simulations of three popular water models and the analysis of recent scattering experimental data, we show that there are two overlapped peaks hidden in the apparent ``first diffraction peak'' of the structure factor. One of them (ordinary peak) corresponds to the neighboring O-O distance as in ordinary liquids, and the other (anomalous peak) corresponds to a longer distance. We reveal that this anomalous peak arises from the most extended period of density wave associated with a tetrahedral water structure and is to be identified as the so-called first sharp diffraction peak that is commonly observed in silica and other tetrahedral liquids. In contrast, the ordinary peak arises from the density wave characteristic of local structures lacking tetrahedral symmetry. This finding unambiguously proves the coexistence of two types of local structures in liquid water. Our findings not only provide vital clues to settle a long-standing controversy on the water structure but also allow direct experimental access to the fraction of tetrahedral structures in liquid water.},

We apply this formula to marine snow formation following a phytoplankton bloom. Over a broad range of aspect ratios, the formula predicts a similar or higher encounter rate between rods as compared to the encounter rate between (equal volume) spheres aggregating either by differential settling or due to turbulence. Since many phytoplankton species are elongated, these results suggest that collisions induced by the orientation-dependent settling velocity can contribute significantly to marine snow formation, and that marine snow composed of elongated phytoplankton cells can form at high rates also in the absence of turbulence.},

At the scale of the organisms, microbial interactions are multi-step processes that are initiated by cell{\textendash}cell or cell{\textendash}resource encounters. Quantification and rational design of microbial interactions thus require quantification of encounter rates. Encounter rates can often be quantified through encounter kernels{\textemdash}mathematical formulae that capture the dependence of encounter rates on cell phenotypes, such as cell size, shape, density or motility, and environmental conditions, such as turbulence intensity or viscosity. While encounter kernels have been studied for over a century, they are often not sufficiently considered in descriptions of microbial populations. Furthermore, formulae for kernels are known only in a small number of canonical encounter scenarios. Yet, encounter kernels can guide experimental efforts to control microbial interactions by elucidating how encounter rates depend on key phenotypic and environmental variables. Encounter kernels also provide physically grounded estimates for parameters that are used in ecological models of microbial populations. We illustrate this encounter-oriented perspective on microbial interactions by reviewing traditional and recently identified kernels describing encounters between microorganisms and between microorganisms and resources in aquatic systems.},

  abstract = {The microenvironment surrounding individual phytoplankton cells is often rich in dissolved organic matter (DOM), which can attract bacteria by chemotaxis. These ``phycospheres'' may be prominent sources of resource heterogeneity in the ocean, affecting the growth of bacterial populations and the fate of DOM. However, these effects remain poorly quantified due to a lack of quantitative ecological frameworks. Here, we used video microscopy to dissect with unprecedented resolution the chemotactic accumulation of marine bacteria around individual               Chaetoceros affinis               diatoms undergoing lysis. The observed spatiotemporal distribution of bacteria was used in a resource utilization model to map the conditions under which competition between different bacterial groups favors chemotaxis. The model predicts that chemotactic, copiotrophic populations outcompete nonmotile, oligotrophic populations during diatom blooms and bloom collapse conditions, resulting in an increase in the ratio of motile to nonmotile cells and in the succession of populations. Partitioning of DOM between the two populations is strongly dependent on the overall concentration of bacteria and the diffusivity of different DOM substances, and within each population, the growth benefit from phycospheres is experienced by only a small fraction of cells. By informing a DOM utilization model with highly resolved behavioral data, the hybrid approach used here represents a new path toward the elusive goal of predicting the consequences of microscale interactions in the ocean.},

  abstract = {Chemotaxis underpins important ecological processes in marine bacteria, from the association with primary producers to the colonization of particles and hosts. Marine bacteria often swim with a single flagellum at high speeds, alternating ``runs'' with either 180{\textdegree} reversals or {$\sim$}90{\textdegree} ``flicks,'' the latter resulting from a buckling instability of the flagellum. These adaptations diverge from               Escherichia coli               's classic run-and-tumble motility, yet how they relate to the strong and rapid chemotaxis characteristic of marine bacteria has remained unknown. We investigated the relationship between swimming speed, run{\textendash}reverse{\textendash}flick motility, and high-performance chemotaxis by tracking thousands of               Vibrio alginolyticus               cells in microfluidic gradients. At odds with current chemotaxis models, we found that chemotactic precision{\textemdash}the strength of accumulation of cells at the peak of a gradient{\textemdash}is swimming-speed dependent in               V. alginolyticus               . Faster cells accumulate twofold more tightly by chemotaxis compared with slower cells, attaining an advantage in the exploitation of a resource additional to that of faster gradient climbing. Trajectory analysis and an agent-based mathematical model revealed that this unexpected advantage originates from a speed dependence of reorientation frequency and flicking, which were higher for faster cells, and was compounded by chemokinesis, an increase in speed with resource concentration. The absence of any one of these adaptations led to a 65{\textendash}70\% reduction in the population-level resource exposure. These findings indicate that, contrary to what occurs in               E. coli               , swimming speed can be a fundamental determinant of the gradient-seeking capabilities of marine bacteria, and suggest a new model of bacterial chemotaxis.},

  abstract = {The idea that water is a mixture of two distinct states is analyzed in some detail. It is shown that the known compressibility of water is in fact sufficiently small that for a volume of water of size 1 nm3, the density fluctuations are of order 4\% of the average density. This is much smaller than the {$\approx$}25\% density fluctuations that would be required for significant regions of high and low density water to occur on this volume scale. It is also pointed out that the density fluctuations in water are, if anything, smaller than those that occur in other common liquids which do not have the anomalous properties of water. It is shown that if the distribution of density fluctuations is unimodal, the system is in the one-phase region, and if bimodal, it is in the two-phase region. None of the liquid or amorphous phases of water explored in this work give any sign of being in the two-phase region. Existing neutron and X-ray scattering data on water in the amorphous phases, and in the stable liquid phases as a function pressure and temperature, are subject to a new set of empirical potential structure refinement simulations. These simulations are interrogated for their configurational entropy, using a spherical harmonic reconstruction of the full orientational pair correlation function. It is shown that the excess pair entropy derived from this function, plus the known perfect gas contributions, give a reasonable account of the total entropy of water, within the likely errors. This estimated entropy follows the expected declining trend with decreasing temperature. Evidence that higher density water will have higher entropy than lower density water emerges, in accordance with what is expected from the negative thermal expansion coefficient of water at low temperatures. However, this entropy increase is not large and goes through a maximum before declining at yet higher densities and pressures, in a manner reminiscent of what has been previously observed in the diffusion coefficient as a function of pressure. There is no evidence that ambient water can be regarded as patches of high density, high entropy and low density, low entropy liquid, as some have claimed, since high density water has a similar entropy to low density water. There is some evidence that the distinction between these two states will become more pronounced as the temperature is lowered. Extensive discussion of the use of order parameters to describe water structure is given, and it is pointed out that these indices generally cannot be used to infer two-state behavior.},

Working               in vivo               , we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the interaction of CheY{$\sim$}P with its target, FliM. Binding of CheY{$\sim$}P to FliM was found to be much less cooperative than motor switching; however, under the conditions of our experiment, most of the FliM appeared to be in the cytoplasm. We studied signal processing times in the chemotaxis pathway by measuring the changes in CheY{$\sim$}P binding to FliM on flash release of caged chemoeffectors. Following sudden addition of attractant, the amount of CheY{$\sim$}P bound to FliM decayed exponentially with a rate constant of about 2 s               -1               . Following sudden addition of repellent, FliM occupancy increased with a rate constant of about 20 s               -1               . Using these data, we were able to construct a simple model for the chemotactic pathway and to estimate values of rate constants for several key reactions.},

Its activity can be inferred from the rotational bias of  flagellar motors, but motor response is stochastic and limited to a  narrow physiological range. Here we use fluorescence resonance energy  transfer to monitor interactions of CheY{$\sim$}P with its phosphatase,  CheZ, that reveal changes in the activity of the receptor kinase, CheA,  resulting from the addition of attractants or repellents.

In               cheRcheB               mutants, the concentration of attractant  that generates a half-maximal response is equal to the dissociation  constant of the receptor.

Although the increase in thermodynamic response functions is not towards a critical point, it is still possible to obtain an apparent power law all the way to the maximum values with best-fit exponents of               {$\gamma$}               = 0.40 {$\pm$} 0.01 for the isothermal compressibility and               {$\nu$}               = 0.26 {$\pm$} 0.03 for the correlation length. The ratio between these exponents is close to a value of {$\approx$}0.5, as expected for a critical point, indicating the proximity of a potential second critical point. Comparison of               {$\gamma$}               obtained from experiment with molecular dynamics simulations on the iAMOEBA water model shows that it would be located at pressures in the neighborhood of 1 kbar.

Residual variation around the fitted straight lines (corresponding to a theoretical steady state) was least for the large, oligotrophic Lake Superior and the North Pacific Gyre and greatest for eutrophic Saginaw Bay and shallow Lake Erie, suggesting progressive departure from steady-state conditions with increasing system productivity. The slopes of the normalized spectra decrease with increasing eutrophy, indicating that nannoplankton abundances are similar in all communities studied, but that associated zooplankton abundances vary by 2.5 orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that parameterization of particle-size models for prediction of potential fish production must be adjusted according to the size and productivity of the ecosystem, and that routine monitoring of communities by the normalized biomass spectrum could provide early warning of nutrient or toxic stress in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Significance             Almost all animals must make decisions on the move. Here, employing an approach that integrates theory and high-throughput experiments (using state-of-the-art virtual reality), we reveal that there exist fundamental geometrical principles that result from the inherent interplay between movement and organisms' internal representation of space. Specifically, we find that animals spontaneously reduce the world into a series of sequential binary decisions, a response that facilitates effective decision-making and is robust both to the number of options available and to context, such as whether options are static (e.g., refuges) or mobile (e.g., other animals). We present evidence that these same principles, hitherto overlooked, apply across scales of biological organization, from individual to collective decision-making.           ,              Choosing among spatially distributed options is a central challenge for animals, from deciding among alternative potential food sources or refuges to choosing with whom to associate. Using an integrated theoretical and experimental approach (employing immersive virtual reality), we consider the interplay between movement and vectorial integration during decision-making regarding two, or more, options in space. In computational models of this process, we reveal the occurrence of spontaneous and abrupt ``critical'' transitions (associated with specific geometrical relationships) whereby organisms spontaneously switch from averaging vectorial information among, to suddenly excluding one among, the remaining options. This bifurcation process repeats until only one option{\textemdash}the one ultimately selected{\textemdash}remains. Thus, we predict that the brain repeatedly breaks multichoice decisions into a series of binary decisions in space{\textendash}time. Experiments with fruit flies, desert locusts, and larval zebrafish reveal that they exhibit these same bifurcations, demonstrating that across taxa and ecological contexts, there exist fundamental geometric principles that are essential to explain how, and why, animals move the way they do.},

The French JGOFS BIOSOPE cruise crossed the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) on a transect between the Marquesas Islands and the Chilean coast on a 7500 km transect (8{\textdegree} S{\textendash}34{\textdegree} S and 8{\textdegree} W{\textendash}72{\textdegree} W). The number and volume distributions of small (3.5100 {$\mu$}m) were analysed combining two instruments, the HIAC/Royco Counter (for the small particles) and the Underwater Video Profiler (UVP, for the large particles). For the HIAC analysis, samples were collected from 12 L CTD Rosette bottles and immediately analysed on board while the UVP provided an estimate of in situ particle concentrations and size in a continuous profile. Out of 76 continuous UVP and 117 discrete HIAC vertical profiles, 25 had both sets of measurements, mostly at a site close to the Marquesas Islands (site MAR) and one in the center of the gyre (site GYR). At GYR, the particle number spectra from few {$\mu$}m to few mm were fit with power relationships having slopes close to -4. At MAR, the high abundance of large objects, probably living organisms, created a shift in the full size spectra of particles such that a single slope was not appropriate. The small particle pool at both sites showed a diel pattern while the large did not, implying that the movement of mass toward the large particles does not take place at daily scale in the SPG area. Despite the relatively simple nature of the number spectra, the volume spectra were more variable because what were small deviations from the straight line in a log-log plot were large variations in the volume estimates. In addition, the mass estimates from the size spectra are very sensitive to crucial parameters such as the fractal dimension and the POC/Dry Weight ratio. Using consistent values for these parameters, we show that the volume of large particles can equal the volume of the smaller particles. However the proportion of material in large particles decreased from the mesotrophic conditions at the border of the SPG to the ultra-oligotrophy of the center in the upper 200 m depth. We expect large particles to play a major role in the trophic interaction in the upper waters of the South Pacific Gyre.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Intuitively, it may seem that from the perspective of an individual bacterium the ocean is a vast, dilute, and largely homogeneous environment. Microbial oceanographers have typically considered the ocean from this point of view. In reality, marine bacteria inhabit a chemical seascape that is highly heterogeneous down to the microscale, owing to ubiquitous nutrient patches, plumes, and gradients. Exudation and excretion of dissolved matter by larger organisms, lysis events, particles, animal surfaces, and fluxes from the sediment-water interface all contribute to create strong and pervasive heterogeneity, where chemotaxis may provide a significant fitness advantage to bacteria. The dynamic nature of the ocean imposes strong selective pressures on bacterial foraging strategies, and many marine bacteria indeed display adaptations that characterize their chemotactic motility as ``high performance'' compared to that of enteric model organisms. Fast swimming speeds, strongly directional responses, and effective turning and steering strategies ensure that marine bacteria can successfully use chemotaxis to very rapidly respond to chemical gradients in the ocean. These fast responses are advantageous in a broad range of ecological processes, including attaching to particles, exploiting particle plumes, retaining position close to phytoplankton cells, colonizing host animals, and hovering at a preferred height above the sediment-water interface. At larger scales, these responses can impact ocean biogeochemistry by increasing the rates of chemical transformation, influencing the flux of sinking material, and potentially altering the balance of biomass incorporation versus respiration. This review highlights the physical and ecological processes underpinning bacterial motility and chemotaxis in the ocean, describes the current state of knowledge of chemotaxis in marine bacteria, and summarizes our understanding of how these microscale dynamics scale up to affect ecosystem-scale processes in the sea.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Most of Earth's biomass is composed of polysaccharides. During biomass decomposition, polysaccharides are degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as a nutrient and energy source and are thereby partly remineralized into CO             2             . As polysaccharides are heterogeneously distributed in nature, following the colonization and degradation of a polysaccharide hotspot the cells need to reach new polysaccharide hotspots. Even though these degradation-dispersal cycles are an integral part in the global carbon cycle, we know little about how cells alternate between degradation and motility, and which environmental factors trigger this behavioral switch. Here, we studied the growth of the marine bacterium             Vibrio cyclitrophicus             ZF270 on the abundant marine polysaccharide alginate. We used microfluidics-coupled time-lapse microscopy to analyze motility and growth of individual cells, and RNA sequencing to study associated changes in gene expression. Single cells grow at reduced rate on alginate until they form large groups that cooperatively break down the polymer. Exposing cell groups to digested alginate accelerates cell growth and changes the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation and catabolism, central metabolism, ribosomal biosynthesis, and transport. However, exposure to digested alginate also triggers cells to become motile and disperse from cell groups, proportionally increasing with the group size before the nutrient switch, accompanied by high expression of genes involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. The motile cells chemotax toward alginate hotspots, likely enabling cells to find new polysaccharide hotspots. Overall, our findings reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles that drive remineralization in natural environments.                                   Importance                            Polysaccharides, also known as glycans, are the most abundant form of biomass on Earth and understanding how they are degraded by microorganisms is essential for our understanding of the global carbon cycle and the storage and release of CO               2               by natural systems. Although group formation is a common strategy used by bacterial cells to degrade ubiquitous polymeric growth substrates in nature, where nutrient hotspots are heterogeneously distributed, little is known about how cells prepare for dispersal from an exhausted nutrient source and re-initiate degradation of new nutrient patches. By quantifying growth, motility and chemotaxis of individual cells and comparing gene expression changes when populations were exposed to either polysaccharides or their degradation products in the form of digested polysaccharides, we show that bacterial cells alter their behavior when they experience a shift from polymeric to digested polysaccharides: After cells form groups during growth on polymers, the exposure to degradation products made cells motile, enabling dispersal from sessile cell groups and - guided by chemotaxis - movement towards new polysaccharide hotspots. Our study sheds light on the cellular processes that drive bacterial growth and behavior during carbon remineralization, an important driver of CO               2               release from biomass in natural systems.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic microbes are the predominant sources of organic carbon in the sunlit regions of the ocean. During photosynthesis, nitrogen and carbon metabolism are coordinated to synthesize nitrogen-containing organics such as amino acids and nucleic acids. In large regions of the ocean, nitrogen is thought to limit the growth of phytoplankton. The impact of nitrogen limitation on the synthesis of organic carbon is not well understood, especially for the most abundant photosynthetic organism in the nitrogen-limited regions of the ocean,               Prochlorococcus               . This study compares the carbon metabolism of nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limited               Prochlorococcus               spp. to determine how nitrogen availability influences inorganic carbon assimilation into an organic form. Metabolomics and physiological data revealed that cells under nitrogen limitation have reduced metabolic flux and total carbon fixation rates while maintaining elevated metabolite pool levels and releasing a larger proportion of total fixed carbon to the environment.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Primary production by               Prochlorococcus               , the smallest known free-living photosynthetic organism in terms of both physical and genomic size, is thought to have a significant role in global carbon cycles. Despite its small size and low growth rate,               Prochlorococcus               numerically dominates the phytoplankton community in the nutrient-poor oligotrophic ocean, the largest biome of the Earth's surface. How nutrient limitation, and nitrogen limitation in particular, affects the fate and flux of carbon fixed by               Prochlorococcus               is currently unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the bulk rates of photosynthesis and organic carbon release, the concentrations of intracellular metabolites, and the rates of assimilated carbon into the metabolite pools between replete and N-limited chemostat cultures. Total photosynthesis of our N-limited cultures was less than half of those observed in replete cultures, and nitrogen limitation also appears to cause a larger proportion of total fixed carbon to be released to the environment. Our data suggest this occurs in concert with the maintenance of large slow-moving pools of metabolites, including nitrogen-rich molecules such as glutamate. Additionally, we report field data suggesting metabolisms of               Prochlorococcus               are comparable to results we observe in our laboratory studies. Accounting for these observations, potential metabolic mechanisms utilized by               Prochlorococcus               are discussed as we build upon our understanding of nutrient-limited photosynthesis and carbon metabolism.

  abstract = {‚ñ™ Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Energy taxis is widespread in motile bacteria and in some species is the only known behavioral response. The bacteria monitor their cellular energy levels and respond to a decrease in energy by swimming to a microenvironment that reenergizes the cells. This is in contrast to classical Escherichia coli chemotaxis in which sensing of stimuli is independent of cellular metabolism. Energy taxis encompasses aerotaxis (taxis to oxygen), phototaxis, redox taxis, taxis to alternative electron acceptors, and chemotaxis to a carbon source. All of these responses share a common signal transduction pathway. An environmental stimulus, such as oxygen concentration or light intensity, modulates the flow of reducing equivalents through the electron transport system. A transducer senses the change in electron transport, or possibly a related parameter such as proton motive force, and initiates a signal that alters the direction of swimming. The Aer and Tsr proteins in E. coli are newly recognized transducers for energy taxis. Aer is homologous to E. coli chemoreceptors but unique in having a PAS domain and a flavin-adenine dinucleotide cofactor that is postulated to interact with a component of the electron transport system. PAS domains are energy-sensing modules that are found in proteins from archaea to humans. Tsr, the serine chemoreceptor, is an independent transducer for energy taxis, but its sensory mechanism is unknown. Energy taxis has a significant ecological role in vertical stratification of microorganisms in microbial mats and water columns. It plays a central role in the behavior of magnetotactic bacteria and also appears to be important in plant-microbe interactions.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of living organisms are organized across many spatial scales. However, current cost-effective imaging systems can measure only a subset of these scales at once. We have created a scalable multi-camera array microscope (MCAM) that enables comprehensive high-resolution recording from multiple spatial scales simultaneously, ranging from structures that approach the cellular scale to large-group behavioral dynamics. By collecting data from up to 96 cameras, we computationally generate gigapixel-scale images and movies with a field of view over hundreds of square centimeters at an optical resolution of 18 {\textmu}m. This allows us to observe the behavior and fine anatomical features of numerous freely moving model organisms on multiple spatial scales, including larval zebrafish, fruit flies, nematodes, carpenter ants, and slime mold. Further, the MCAM architecture allows stereoscopic tracking of the z-position of organisms using the overlapping field of view from adjacent cameras. Overall, by removing the bottlenecks imposed by single-camera image acquisition systems, the MCAM provides a powerful platform for investigating detailed biological features and behavioral processes of small model organisms across a wide range of spatial scales.},

The Noyes theory is analysed and used to predict the kinetics of the               two-dimensional               irreversible reaction A + B {\textrightarrow} P. Only condensed phase reactions with molecules of A and B undergoing Brownian motion (diffusion) are discussed. For comparison, all calculations are done in both two and three dimensions.

The theoretical rate function is determined as a function of the probability               {$\alpha$}               of reaction given an encounter.

  abstract = {Regulatory networks as large and complex as those implicated in cell-fate choice are expected to exhibit intricate, very high-dimensional dynamics. Cell-fate choice, however, is a macroscopically simple process. Additionally, regulatory network models are almost always incomplete and/or inexact, and do not incorporate all the regulators and interactions that may be involved in cell-fate regulation. In spite of these issues, regulatory network models have proven to be incredibly effective tools for understanding cell-fate choice across contexts and for making useful predictions. Here, we show that minimal frustration{\textemdash}a feature of biological networks across contexts but not of random networks{\textemdash}can compel simple, low-dimensional steady-state behavior even in large and complex networks. Moreover, the steady-state behavior of minimally frustrated networks can be recapitulated by simpler networks such as those lacking many of the nodes and edges and those that treat multiple regulators as one. The present study provides a theoretical explanation for the success of network models in biology and for the challenges in network inference.},

  abstract = {In their natural environment, cells need to extract useful information from complex temporal signals that vary over a wide range of intensities and time scales. Here, we study how such signals are processed by               Escherichia coli               during chemotaxis by developing a general theoretical model based on receptor adaptation and receptor{\textendash}receptor cooperativity. Measured responses to various monotonic, oscillatory, and impulsive stimuli are all explained consistently by the underlying adaptation kinetics within this model. For exponential ramp signals, an analytical solution is discovered that reveals a remarkable connection between the dependence of kinase activity on the exponential ramp rate and the receptor methylation rate function. For exponentiated sine-wave signals, spectral analysis shows that the chemotaxis pathway acts as a lowpass filter for the derivative of the signal with the cutoff frequency determined by an intrinsic adaptation time scale. For large step stimuli, we find that the recovery time is determined by the constant maximum methylation rate, which provides a natural explanation for the observed recovery time additivity. Our model provides a quantitative system-level description of the chemotaxis signaling pathway and can be used to predict               E. coli               chemotaxis responses to arbitrary temporal signals. This model of the receptor system reveals the molecular origin of Weber's law in bacterial chemotaxis. We further identify additional constraints required to account for the related observation that the output of this pathway is constant under exponential ramp stimuli, a feature that we call ``logarithmic tracking.''},

The filaments can exist in different polymorphic forms, having distinct values of curvature and twist. Rotation rates are on the order of 100 Hz. In the past, the motion of individual filaments has been visualized by dark-field or differential-interference-contrast microscopy, methods hampered by intense scattering from the cell body or shallow depth of field, respectively. We have found a simple procedure for fluorescently labeling cells and filaments that allows recording their motion in real time with an inexpensive video camera and an ordinary fluorescence microscope with mercury-arc or strobed laser illumination. We report our initial findings with cells of               Escherichia coli               . Tumbles (events that enable swimming cells to alter course) are remarkably varied. Not every filament on a cell needs to change its direction of rotation: different filaments can change directions at different times, and a tumble can result from the change in direction of only one. Polymorphic transformations tend to occur in the sequence normal, semicoiled, curly 1, with changes in the direction of movement of the cell body correlated with transformations to the semicoiled form.},

Chemotaxis allows swimming bacterial cells to follow chemical gradients in the environment by performing temporal comparisons of ligand concentrations. The process of chemotaxis in the model bacterium               Escherichia coli               has been studied in great molecular detail over the past 40~years, using a large range of experimental tools to investigate physiology, genetics and biochemistry of the system. The abundance of quantitative experimental data enabled detailed computational modeling of the pathway and theoretical analyses of such properties as robustness and signal amplification. Because of the temporal mode of gradient sensing in bacterial chemotaxis, molecular memory is an essential component of the chemotaxis pathway. Recent studies suggest that the memory time scale has been evolutionary optimized to perform optimal comparisons of stimuli while swimming in the gradient. Moreover, noise in the adaptation system, which results from variations of the adaptation rate both over time and among cells, might be beneficial for the overall chemotactic performance of the population.},

  abstract = {Most studies on visual foraging by fish have focused on reaction distances to invertebrate prey; however, these acuity-based results considerably overestimate reaction distances of piscivores to prey fish. In laboratory experiments, we quantified reaction distance of adult lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) as a function of light (0.17-261 lx), prey size (55, 75, and 139 mm), and turbidity (0.09, 3.18, and 7.40 NTU). Reaction distances increased rapidly with increasing light from {$<$}25 cm at 0.17 lx to about 100 cm at a light threshold of 17.8 lx. Reaction distance declined as a decaying power function of turbidity. By constructing equations that describe the combined effects of light and turbidity on reaction distances, we can begin to model prey detection capabilities of piscivores at any depth at any time of day in natural environments.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that the anomalous behavior of liquid water is related to the existence of a second critical point in deeply supercooled states has long been the subject of intense debate. Recent, sophisticated experiments designed to observe the transformation between the two subcritical liquids on nano- and microsecond time scales, along with demanding numerical simulations based on classical (rigid) models parameterized to reproduce thermodynamic properties of water, have provided support to this hypothesis. A stronger numerical proof requires demonstrating that the critical point, which occurs at temperatures and pressures far from those at which the models were optimized, is robust with respect to model parameterization, specifically with respect to incorporating additional physical effects. Here, we show that a liquid{\textendash}liquid critical point can be rigorously located also in the WAIL model of water [Pinnick et al., J. Chem. Phys. 137, 014510 (2012)], a model parameterized using ab initio calculations only. The model incorporates two features not present in many previously studied water models: It is both flexible and polarizable, properties which can significantly influence the phase behavior of water. The observation of the critical point in a model in which the water{\textendash}water interaction is estimated using only quantum ab initio calculations provides strong support to the viewpoint according to which the existence of two distinct liquids is a robust feature in the free energy landscape of supercooled water.},

Bacteria and plankton experience a broad range of flows, from the chaotic motion characteristic of turbulence to smooth flows at boundaries and in confined environments. Flow creates forces and torques that affect the movement, behavior, and spatial distribution of microorganisms and shapes the chemical landscape on which they rely for nutrient acquisition and communication. Methodological advances and closer interactions between physicists and biologists have begun to reveal the importance of flow{\textendash}microorganism interactions and the adaptations of microorganisms to flow. Here we review selected examples of such interactions from bacteria, phytoplankton, larvae, and zooplankton. We hope that this article will serve as a blueprint for a more in-depth consideration of the effects of flow in the biology of microorganisms and that this discussion will stimulate further multidisciplinary effort in understanding this important component of microorganism habitats.},

To maximize lifetime fitness, the exploratory behavior has to be flexible, but which behavioral elements adapt and what triggers those changes remain elusive. Using experiments and modeling, we characterized extensively how               Drosophila               larvae foraging adapts to different food quality and distribution and how the foraging genetic background influences this adaptation. Our work shows that different food properties modulated specific motor programs. Food quality controls the traveled distance by modulating crawling speed and frequency of pauses and turns. Food distribution, and in particular the food{\textendash}no food interface, controls turning behavior, stimulating turns toward the food when reaching the patch border and increasing the proportion of time spent within patches of food. Finally, the polymorphism in the               foraging               gene (rover{\textendash}sitter) of the larvae adjusts the magnitude of the behavioral response to different food conditions. This study defines several levels of control of foraging and provides the basis for the systematic identification of the neuronal circuits and mechanisms controlling each behavioral response.},

Pure water crystallizes before such conditions can be reached. Woutersen               et al.               studied hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solutions that have similar hydrogen bonding to that of water. They observed a liquid-liquid transition near 190 K by using infrared spectroscopy and calorimetry. The liquid states were analogous to the predicted high- and low-density amorphous phases of water.

We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.},

By combining single-cell tracking with mathematical modeling, we show that bacteria foraging on seascapes of organic particles switch between attached and planktonic lifestyles and tune the time spent on particles to increase individual fitness. As predicted by patch use theory, bacteria remain longer on particles of higher quality and in poor environments, or when search times for fresh particles are longer. These results show that patch use theory can be a valuable framework to understand not only animals, but also microorganisms, and ultimately their ecosystem-level consequences.           ,                             Optimal foraging theory provides a framework to understand how organisms balance the benefits of harvesting resources within a patch with the sum of the metabolic, predation, and missed opportunity costs of foraging. Here, we show that, after accounting for the limited environmental information available to microorganisms, optimal foraging theory and, in particular, patch use theory also applies to the behavior of marine bacteria in particle seascapes. Combining modeling and experiments, we find that the marine bacterium               Vibrio ordalii               optimizes nutrient uptake by rapidly switching between attached and planktonic lifestyles, departing particles when their nutrient concentration is more than hundredfold higher than background. In accordance with predictions from patch use theory, single-cell tracking reveals that bacteria spend less time on nutrient-poor particles and on particles within environments that are rich or in which the travel time between particles is smaller, indicating that bacteria tune the nutrient concentration at detachment to increase their fitness. A mathematical model shows that the observed behavioral switching between exploitation and dispersal is consistent with foraging optimality under limited information, namely, the ability to assess the harvest rate of nutrients leaking from particles by molecular diffusion. This work demonstrates how fundamental principles in behavioral ecology traditionally applied to animals can hold right down to the scale of microorganisms and highlights the exquisite adaptations of marine bacterial foraging. The present study thus provides a blueprint for a mechanistic understanding of bacterial uptake of dissolved organic matter and bacterial production in the ocean{\textemdash}processes that are fundamental to the global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Turbulent microfluidic mixer in simple linear geometry was developed for the first time by bonding PDMS and glass with strong nano-adhesion layer           ,                             Over the past decade, homogeneous mixing in microfluidic devices has been a critical challenge, because of the inherently low flow rates in microfluidic channels. Although several mixer designs have been suggested to achieve efficient mixing, most of them involve intricate structures requiring a series of laborious fabrication processes. Operation at high flow rates can greatly enhance mixing by induction of turbulence, but devices that can resist such a high pressure drop to induce turbulence in microfluidic channels are difficult to fabricate, especially for commonly used poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based microfluidic devices. We have developed a Y-shaped, turbulent microfluidic mixer made of PDMS and a glass substrate by strong bonding of the substrates to a nanoadhesive layer deposited               via               initiated chemical vapor deposition. The high bonding strength of the nanoadhesive layer enables safe operation of the PDMS/glass turbulent microfluidic mixer at a total water flow rate of 40 mL min               -1               , corresponding to a Reynolds number, Re, of {\textasciitilde}4423, one of the highest values achieved in a microfluidic channel. The turbulence generated as a result of the high Re allows rapid mixing of the input fluids on contact. Image analysis showed that mixing started as soon as the fluids were introduced into the mixer. The experimental results matched the numerical predictions well, demonstrating that convective mixing was dominant as a result of turbulence induced in the microfluidic channel. Using the turbulent microfluidic mixer, we have demonstrated high throughput formation of emulsions with narrower size distribution. It was shown that as the flow rate increases inside the microfluidic channel, the size distribution of resulting emulsions decreases owing to the increase in the turbulent energy dissipation. The turbulent microfluidic mixer developed in this work not only enables rapid mixing of streams, but also increases throughputs of microfluidic reactors.},

  abstract = {In bird flocks, fish schools, and many other living organisms, regrouping among individuals of the same kin is frequently an advantageous strategy to survive, forage, and face predators. However, these behaviors are costly because the community must develop regulatory mechanisms to coordinate and adapt its response to rapid environmental changes. In principle, these regulatory mechanisms, involving communication between individuals, may also apply to cellular systems which must respond collectively during multicellular development. Dissecting the mechanisms at work requires amenable experimental systems, for example, developing bacteria. Myxococcus xanthus, a Gram-negative delatproteobacterium, is able to coordinate its motility in space and time to swarm, predate, and grow millimeter-size spore-filled fruiting bodies. A thorough understanding of the regulatory mechanisms first requires studying how individual cells move across solid surfaces and control their direction of movement, which was recently boosted by new cell biology techniques. In this review, we describe current molecular knowledge of the motility mechanism and its regulation as a lead-in to discuss how multicellular cooperation may have emerged from several layers of regulation: chemotaxis, cell{\textendash}cell signaling, and the extracellular matrix. We suggest that Myxococcus is a powerful system to investigate collective principles that may also be relevant to other cellular systems.},
