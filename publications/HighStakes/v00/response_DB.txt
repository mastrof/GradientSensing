- Q: If we're talking about this as a 'game', another important factor to consider could be the magnitude of the payoff. Can we say something general about the nutrients acquired for different sized targets in addition to the statistics of search times?
- A: Most likely, we don't want to deal with nutrient acquisition here. Maintaining proximity and acquiring nutrients are a rather different problem. In this paper the focus needs to be on the reduction in search times; I'm not yet 100% sure whether we can present it as the payoff itself (I'm sure it is a valid assumption for some problmes), or if it's better to present it as a term among the many that constitute a more complex payoff function. The best we can do is probably acknowledge this inherent complexity citing appropriate literature on the nutrient acquisition aspects, but keep the focus on *only* the reduction in search times.

- Q: "produce an encounter with 100% probability" So this is a pretty major assumption, since the effectiveness is actually likely to depend on the size of the target.
- A: Yes, it's a major assumption but it's what we want. We don't pretend that bacteria operate with 100% effectiveness, we calculate an upper bound on what they can do. The upper bound tells you how much game there is in a given region of parameter space; whether you are able to play the game optimally is a whole different matter. Investigating how much real bacteria would stray away from this upper bound would be interesting (and I have been playing a bit with some simulations to check this), but I feel it's not really a well-posed problem: it's very complicate to get any significant result because, on top of a non-trivial dependency on size and concentration field, the effectiveness will also vary between slightly different implementations of the chemotactic mechanism (trivially, your model from the 2019 PNAS will perform differently from the model of Brown and Berg etc...). This upper bound is probably the best we can do now.

- Q: Can you explain in more detail here why the smoothly varying cutoff function is employed, as opposed to just finding the radius where effective SNR exceeds 1?
- A: The cutoff function is required to represent phycospheres that are too small for their signal to be properly measured. The "raw" SNR only measures the ratio between the "real" signal (-U dC/dr) and the inherent noise (Πσ). If, however, the signal is contained within a single sensory window, we cannot take -U dC/dr to be representative of the signal experienced by the bacterium. This cutoff function then represents a degradation of the signal. As soon as S is larger than 2UT, f(S/UT) ~ 1, when S=UT we have f(1) = 1/2, and then for S<UT an exponential cutoff which quickly goes to 0. The exact form of this cutoff function is still somewhat arbitrary; you can make it more or less steep, but fundamentally any f which satisfies f(0)=0 and f(x>2)~1 will give qualitatively equivalent results. I believe there is one way to get the "correct" cutoff function for a given problem, which is based on more rigorously using the definition of Nyquist frequency: the "degradation" of a measured signal due to limited frequency is really an incomplete reconstruction of the signal spectrum; if you measure with a high-enough frequency, you cover the entire spectrum, but if you measure with frequencies lower than Nyquist, than the spectrum of your measured signal starts to lose the high-frequency components. The "signal degradation" measured by the cutoff function would then be something like the ratio between the integral of the measured spectrum and the integral of the real spectrum of the signal. I tried to do the calculation for this system a few months ago but then I got stuck, will need to look again into that. All this is somewhat technical but in my opinion deserves a paragraph in the SI.

- Q: Regarding the functional form of the nutrient landscape. You used the widely accepted model of steady leaker with no background  decay (C~1/r). I wondered if you had also considered investigating one with uniform uptake by background bacteria (which gives C~exp(-k*r)/r as in our 2023 NanoSIMS paper)? I don’t suggest that you repeat everything with this form, but it might be interesting to see what happens in some cases.
- A: I don't have values under my hand right now but intuitively I would expect the lengthscale associated to uniform uptake to be on the order of 1/k ~ 10μm, which means there would be close to no effect on the small phytoplankton cells. Not sure what would happen for the mid-sized and larger ones but might be worth trying it out and see what happens. I will do this in the coming weeks.
